# Provenance

This tree is a move-only reorganization of
[`plby/HopfProblem`](https://github.com/plby/HopfProblem) at commit
`9ac8a456b526527837d7082ff775213ca8bc9809` (Apache-2.0).

The original `Solution.lean` had SHA-256 `fda66f602707b290cf7fba9111506b39d72b2f509f9ebb44a1901471c69dec49`.  Its declaration
body, original lines 80--248811 inclusive, is partitioned into the `Hopf/`
modules listed in `SPLIT_MANIFEST.json`.  Each listed body is an exact byte
slice of that pinned source; no proof body or theorem statement is edited by
the extraction.  Module wrappers and imports are the only generated Lean text
outside those slices.  All 2,543 original attribute commands are command-scoped
wrappers and remain inside their exact body slices.

The full original attribution/license header is retained in every extracted
Lean module and in the public root aggregator.  `Solution.lean` imports
`Hopf.Final`.  The original `Challenge.lean`, `LICENSE`, and comparator
configuration are not changed by the splitter.  Mathematical equivalence must
additionally be certified by a green `lake build`, unchanged Comparator
verdict, and unchanged per-theorem axiom audit before committing the
reorganization.

The audited splitter is retained on the split branch as
`scripts/split_solution.py`.  It intentionally remains outside its own
generated-state hash map, avoiding circular self-authentication; Git and the
external attestation receipt pin the script itself.  A second run validates
all generator-owned output and leaves the script untouched.

## V10 algebraic shortcut source

The `simplify/v10-shortcuts` branch imports the following unconditional Lean
sources from the companion S6 V10 release at commit
`8e83d2d2bc4e4ba32b8dfe0ecfe9094d3834cea0`:

- `S6Shortcuts.lean`;
- `S6/CyclicAverage.lean`;
- `S6/LatticeOrbitIndex.lean`;
- `S6/SquareZeroExchange.lean`;
- `S6/TwoExceptionalGluing.lean`;
- `S6/UnitTransgression.lean`.

Those six files are copied byte-for-byte from
`formal/lean-source/` in that source commit.  They contain 1,244 lines and 165
source declaration commands: 149 are non-private/non-local, 14 are private,
and 2 are local.  The new `S6.lean` file is only the local Lake routing root.
The source project used Lean 4.31.0-rc1; the unchanged files also elaborate
under this repository's pinned Lean 4.33.0/Mathlib v4.33.0 environment.  They
are included under this repository's Apache-2.0 license.

The initial port changes no Hopf theorem or proof.  Later entries in this file
must identify each replacement or explanatory bridge, its exact S6 source
module, measured source delta, build/axiom gate, and final Comparator status.

## Section 6 reusable linear-algebra library

The proof-independent parts of V10 Lemmas 6.1--6.3 and 6.6 now live under
`Lib/LinearAlgebra/`.  `Lib.lean` is a public routing root and a separate Lake
library target.  It imports no `S6Shortcuts`, `S6`, `Hopf`, `Challenge`, or
`Solution` module.  The concrete matrix certificates remain in `S6/` as
proof-owned adapters which import the reusable layer.

This first extraction exports 25 reusable source declarations: 10 for cyclic
averaging, 11 for square-zero exchanges, and 4 for full-rank integral lattice
index.  Their general theorem bodies were moved intact from the checked V10
modules; the only proof-text modernization is Mathlib's nonsemantic
`LinearEquiv.ofLinearMap` spelling for the deprecated alias
`LinearEquiv.ofLinear`.  `Lib/AxiomAudit.lean` queries every export directly.

In the expansion ledger, all 25 exports are library assets and therefore
**free**.  The namespace-routing edits in the S6/Hopf consumers are
proof-specific adapters; this extraction does not count library lines,
declarations, or bytes as proof cost.  It also makes no claim that every
export is already a verbatim Mathlib pull request: natural-namespace and
generality refinement is a separate, checker-gated library step.  Comparator
remains deferred to the single final accumulated-change gate.

## Section 6 reusable group and homological library

The proof-independent group and homological modules now live under
`Lib/GroupTheory/` and `Lib/HomologicalAlgebra/`.  This migration moves the 23
two-exceptional gluing declarations and 15 unit-transgression declarations out
of the proof-owned `S6/` tree.  It also restores the previously omitted V10
Lemma 6.13 development as `Lib/GroupTheory/SplitExtension.lean`, exporting 21
split-extension and coinvariant declarations.

The authoritative inputs are from S6 V10 source commit
`8e83d2d2bc4e4ba32b8dfe0ecfe9094d3834cea0`.  Their pre-relocation SHA-256
digests are:

- `S6/TwoExceptionalGluing.lean`:
  `6a9d2967cee09a08049706980bf1a65b73374716459d7cef32c75a27164d9c4d`;
- `S6/UnitTransgression.lean`:
  `2ee8d2cb7ec688e2e3dd5e7565126972058e2048a9ff7f840e46264013fbf8aa`;
- `S6/SplitExtension.lean`:
  `c3892dd31b191d694a69319f73d496a0e49fb9e8abb64905463df3e15065db2b`.

All three files retain their V10 theorem statements and proof bodies.
`UnitTransgression` changes only its module namespace.  In addition to its
namespace move, `TwoExceptionalGluing` uses the relocated cyclic-average
import and four correspondingly qualified library names.  The restored
split-extension library form adds the repository's Apache-2.0 header, updates
the module documentation, and changes the namespace.

At commit `13f4be627cbefa415e62069edfbb9d5d412c6b30`, the cumulative Section 6
library surface is therefore 84 public source declarations, and
`Lib/AxiomAudit.lean` queries all 84 names individually.  In
the expansion ledger every one is a free library asset; the only charged
changes are the proof-specific namespace/import adapters in Hopf and S6.

The export boundary does not conceal formalization gaps.  The presented
gluing group is not yet identified with its relation cokernel; the
unit-transgression module consumes explicit low-degree filtration data rather
than constructing a Leray spectral sequence; and the Euler-localization and
conductor/ghost lemmas have no Lean implementation here.  No axiom or
placeholder stands in for those missing results.  Natural Mathlib namespace
and generality refinement remains a later library-only step.  Comparator is
still deferred to the single final accumulated-change gate.

## Mathlib-shaped linear APIs

The three linear modules now use natural Mathlib declaration namespaces and
minimal public imports.  Cyclic averages and square-zero one-plus-scalar flows
are owned by `Module.End`; the full-rank integral cokernel theorem is owned by
`Matrix`.  The square-zero module is routed as
`Lib/LinearAlgebra/SquareZero.lean`, and the determinant theorem as
`Lib/LinearAlgebra/FreeModule/Finite/CardQuotient.lean`.

This refinement turns the original 25-name linear export surface into 22
higher-rank names.  The two lattice notation aliases move to the proof-owned
`S6.LatticeOrbitIndex` adapter, while the custom matrix-injectivity helper is
replaced by Mathlib's existing `Matrix.mulVec_injective_of_det_ne_zero`.
`Module.End.comp_cyclicAverage` is generalized from scalar-valued observables
to linear maps into any module.  The current cumulative library audit covers
81 names individually.

The three-name reduction is not a loss or a credit in the expansion ledger:
library code remains free, and removing redundant/adapter-shaped public names
raises rank per name.  No compatibility aliases preserve the former `Lib.*`
declaration namespaces.  Concrete S6 and Hopf consumers call the natural APIs
directly.  Comparator remains deferred to the single final accumulated-change
gate.

## Standard coinvariants for semidirect-product abelianization

`Lib/GroupTheory/Abelianization/SemidirectProduct.lean` expresses the
abelianization of a semidirect product through Mathlib's standard
`Representation.Coinvariants` of the induced integral representation on the
kernel's abelianization.  Its declarations live in the natural
`Abelianization` and `SemidirectProduct` namespaces, and its ten-name public
surface hides all proof-construction maps behind the final equivalence and its
four simp lemmas.

The first additive commit retained the older one-step quotient model for one
green transition step.  The subsequent exchange replaces its 21 bespoke names
with `GroupExtension.Splitting.abelianizationMulEquiv`, a one-composition
corollary of Mathlib's existing split-extension equivalence and the new
semidirect-product theorem.  The resulting 11-name library surface is stated
entirely through standard coinvariants and natural namespaces; the cumulative
per-export audit covers 71 names.

`PeriodFamily.Data.fundamentalGroupAbelianizationEquiv` is the attached
proof-specific consumer.  It composes the long proof's already checked
semidirect-product equivalence with the reusable theorem.  This adapter is
charged; every line of the 11-name reusable API is free.  The declaration is
checked by the project build but is not claimed to lie in the final
`mathoverflow_1973` theorem's dependency closure.  Comparator remains deferred
to the single final accumulated-change gate.

## Primitive cokernels, commuting generators, and filtration collapse

Three further natural modules expose the generic cores folded into the V10
gluing and low-degree-filtration adapters:

- `Matrix.quotientRangeToLin'EquivZModOfIsCoprime` and its arbitrary-basis
  form identify a primitive rank-two integral matrix cokernel with the cyclic
  module determined by its determinant;
- `Subgroup.isMulCommutative_of_closure_eq_top` turns a pairwise-commuting
  generating set into a commutative ambient group, with an additive theorem
  generated by `to_additive`;
- two `AddSubgroup` lemmas collapse one- and two-step filtrations whose
  successive quotients are trivial.

This additive transition changes no proof adapter.  It adds five public source
commands and audits six exported environment names, counting the generated
additive theorem explicitly.  The cumulative library surface is 76 public
source commands and 77 individually audited exported names.  Every declaration
in these three modules is a free library asset; there is no charged addition or
claimed proof-specific credit in this commit.  The older gluing and
unit-transgression staging modules remain until their consumers are exchanged
in separately green commits.  Comparator remains deferred to the single final
accumulated-change gate.

## Two-exceptional gluing adapter exchange

The paper-facing relation data now lives in
`S6/TwoExceptionalGluing.lean`.  Its 20 public declarations are
proof-specific adapters: they specialize the reusable
`Matrix.quotientRangeToLinEquivZModOfIsCoprime` theorem to the paper's
rank-two relation matrix and use
`Subgroup.isMulCommutative_of_closure_eq_top` for the presentation's
commuting-generator step.  These adapters are charged; the underlying
`Matrix` and `Subgroup` declarations remain free library assets.

The exchange retires the five implementation-facing public names
`bezoutQ`, `classifyingMap`,
`classifyingMap_relationMap_eq_zero`,
`range_relationMap_eq_ker_classifyingMap`, and
`classifyingMap_surjective`.  It adds the explicit paper relation matrix and
the theorem identifying its linear map.  No compatibility aliases preserve
the former `Lib.GroupTheory.TwoExceptionalGluing` namespace.

After this exchange, the reusable library surface is 53 public source
commands and 54 individually audited exported environment names, counting
the generated additive commuting-generator theorem explicitly.  The
proof-owned S6 audit covers all 20 gluing adapter names separately.  The Hopf
proof consumes only `S6.TwoExceptionalGluing.gluingDefect`; the remaining
paper adapters are project-build-checked but are not claimed to lie in the
final theorem's dependency closure.  Comparator remains deferred to the
single final accumulated-change gate.

## Unit-transgression adapter exchange

The 15 low-degree bookkeeping declarations now live in
`S6/UnitTransgression.lean`.  They are paper-specific inputs and
consequences, so they are charged adapters rather than reusable library
assets.  The degree-two and degree-three collapse proofs call the free generic
`AddSubgroup.eq_top_of_le_of_quotient_subsingleton` theorem directly.

This exchange retires the private nine-line
`filtration_bottom_eq_top` hand proof with no new proof-specific helper.
That is a gross and net nine-line specific credit.  The reusable one-step and
two-step filtration theorems remain free under
`Lib/Algebra/Group/Filtration.lean`; their lines are never charged.
No compatibility aliases preserve the former
`Lib.HomologicalAlgebra.UnitTransgression` namespace.

The final reusable library surface is 38 public source commands and 39
individually audited exported environment names, counting the generated
additive commuting-generator theorem.  `S6/AxiomAudit.lean` separately
queries all 35 paper-owned gluing and unit-transgression adapters.  The Hopf
proof has no consumer of the unit-transgression adapter, so it is
project-build-checked but is not claimed to lie in the final theorem's
dependency closure.

This module still consumes explicit post-page filtration data; it does not
construct or run a Leray spectral sequence.  No placeholder or axiom stands
in for that missing analytic/homological layer.  Comparator remains deferred
to the single final accumulated-change gate.

## Square-zero cusp exchange

`Hopf/Shortcuts.lean` defines the integral dual-cusp endomorphism
`dualCuspN = Matrix.toLin' (M₀ - 1)` and proves it square-zero from Hopf's
existing coordinate formula.  `Hopf/LCP/LocalModels.lean` then identifies the
explicit cusp matrix family with
`Module.End.oneAddSMul dualCuspN`
and proves `cuspIntegralMatrix_add` through the generic
`Module.End.oneAddSMul_mul_oneAddSMul` theorem.  The public additive-law statement and all
downstream consumers are unchanged.

Relative to the source-port commit, this replacement adds one 35-line bridge
module and changes the local-model file by +15/-4 lines: **+46 Lean lines,
+1,569 bytes, and +3 public declaration commands project-wide**.  It is an
explanatory routing improvement, not a net source shrink.  The commit receipt
under `~/s6-notes/hopf/phase5/commit02-squarezero/` records the Lake and direct
per-theorem axiom gates.  Per the current protocol, Comparator is deferred to
the one final accumulated-shortcuts run.

## Two-exceptional twist arithmetic

`Hopf/LCP/BoundaryTopology.lean` now defines `twistOrder` as the `(3,4)`
specialization of `S6.TwoExceptionalGluing.gluingDefect`.  The concrete
`main_twist_value` proof is `rfl`, rather than an invocation of the generic
consecutive-order theorem, so its previously empty axiom set remains empty.
The sole downstream unfolding exposes both routed definitions.  The 23 public
declaration statements and the presentation data remain unchanged; only
`c_twistOrder`'s unfolding proof is adjusted, so the former 140-line block is
retained at 142 source lines.  This commit makes no presentation-equivalence
or deletion claim.

Relative to the square-zero commit, the proof-source change is **+3 Lean
lines, +96 bytes, and 0 declaration commands**.  The receipt under
`~/s6-notes/hopf/phase5/commit03-twist/` records the Lake and direct
per-theorem axiom gates.  Comparator remains deferred to the one final
accumulated-shortcuts run.

## Rational cyclic-average endpoints

`Hopf/LCP/IntegralHomology.lean` now records that, after scalar extension to
`ℚ`, the order-three and order-four integral norm matrices are respectively
`3 • S6Shortcuts.P3` and `4 • S6Shortcuts.P4`.  These are explanatory
endpoints connecting Hopf's unnormalized integral norms to the normalized
projectors formalized in `S6.CyclicAverage`.

No integral or topological norm proof is replaced or deleted.  In particular,
the new rational equalities do not identify an integral fixed lattice, prove
saturation, or replace the homology-coordinate transport.  Relative to the
twist-arithmetic commit, this derived-only bridge adds **17 Lean lines, 803
bytes, and 2 public theorem declarations**.  The receipt under
`~/s6-notes/hopf/phase5/commit04-cyclic/` records the Lake and direct
per-theorem axiom gates.  Comparator remains deferred to the one final
accumulated-shortcuts run.

## Real cusp equivalence through square-zero exchange

`Hopf/Shortcuts.lean` now records the real scalar extension
`dualCuspNReal` of the integral dual-cusp endomorphism, together with its
coordinate formula and square-zero law.  `Hopf/LCP/LocalModels.lean`
identifies the real cusp matrix with the corresponding
`Module.End.oneAddSMul`, and defines `cuspRealEquiv` using the generic
`Module.End.oneAddSMulEquiv`.  Its public application formula, zero, addition,
negation, real-cast, complex-cast, and lattice-preservation interfaces are
retained; the one direct homology consumer is routed through the retained
application formula.

This is an abstraction replacement, not a mathematical or source-size
reduction.  Relative to the cyclic-average commit, the proof-source change is
**+21 Lean lines, +1,323 bytes, and +4 public declaration commands**.  The
receipt under `~/s6-notes/hopf/phase5/commit05-cusp-real/` records the full
Lake build, sampled aggregate process-group RSS, and direct per-theorem axiom
gates.  The RSS sample can double-count shared pages and can miss peaks between
samples; it is not a cgroup or unique-memory measurement.  Comparator remains
deferred to the one final accumulated-shortcuts run.
