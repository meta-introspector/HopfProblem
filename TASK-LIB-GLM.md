# TASK LIB-GLM — pure-move extraction lanes A, D1, D2, E1, H, I, B

**TruthSeed:** `lib-extraction:pure-moves-textbook-before-lean`
**For:** GLM-5.3-Flash, working on a fork of github.com/fabianx-ai/HopfProblem,
branch `lib/textbook-extraction` (base commit 721fc82; toolchain
leanprover/lean4:v4.33.0; Mathlib pinned in lake-manifest.json).
**Environment:** Seat setup on the shared box: `SEAT-SETUP.md` (repository root).
**Nature:** GENERIC library extraction, upstream-shaped. Mathematics for the
commons: Mathlib-shaped paths and names, a docstring on every public
declaration, no project vocabulary inside `Lib/`. Read `lean-protocol.md`
(repository root, section "Extraction mode" governs your lanes) and
`Lib/README.md` FIRST and follow them: Axis 1 (the
module docstring: statement, reference, outline, results) before any Lean is
touched, then the section headers, then the move.
`Lib/EXTRACTION_PLAN.md` is the plan; its §2 table gives every source line
range on 721fc82 and every target file; its §3 gives the validation recipe;
its §7 the hazards. This task file only sequences your lanes.

**Reference example: `Lib/AlgebraicTopology/Hurewicz/` — follow this.**
Before starting any lane, read the five files (the finished degree-one
Hurewicz extraction of github.com/fabianx-ai/mathlib4 PR #4, copied verbatim
apart from import paths; they build against the pinned Mathlib in 8 s with
axioms `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`), `Degree1.lean` lines
12–70 first. Their Lean came first and the textbook was written into them
afterwards without changing a proof term; your pure moves are work of the same
kind. `Lib/README.md`, section "Reference example", explains each point; this
is the checklist.

COPY
1. Mathlib header (no SPDX line), `module`, minimal `public import`s, one
   module docstring, `open` lines, `@[expose] public noncomputable section`,
   one `namespace` block, `variable`s hoisted once per block; no unused
   `set_option`/`universe` (`Degree1.lean` 1–77).
2. Module docstring in this order: `# Title`; the theorem with the exact type
   of the headline declaration; `## Outline of the proof`, numbered, every
   step naming its declarations; `## Main definitions and results`;
   `## References` with the bib key; `## Tags` (`Degree1.lean` 12–70).
   Interface files: what is provided, results list, who instantiates it
   (`CycleClasses.lean` 11–33).
3. `/-! ### … -/` section headers in proof order, with prose where the
   textbook glosses a step (`Degree1.lean` 417–422, 507–512;
   `SimplexPaths.lean` 181–185).
4. A role-stating docstring on every public `def`, `abbrev`, `theorem`,
   `lemma` (`SimplexPaths.lean` 446–449; `Degree1.lean` 838–841, 945–946,
   218–222).
5. Names: textbook names for headline objects (`hurewiczHom`,
   `hurewiczEquiv`); `_apply`, `_val`, `_def`; `_eq_iff`, `_eq_zero_iff`;
   `_surjective`, `_injective`; `Foo.map`, `Foo.map_id`, `Foo.map_comp`,
   `Foo.map_<generator>`; `<thing>_induction_on` with `@[elab_as_elim]`;
   `<equiv>_symm_<generator>`; `**The … theorem**` opening the headline
   docstring (`Degree1.lean` 964–968, 1005–1012).
6. One face/edge/boundary computation per lemma, short; `private` only for
   cast normalizations and proof-internal bridges, placed right before their
   single consumer.
7. Morphism-level squares with `@[reassoc (attr := simp), elementwise
   (attr := simp)]`, element forms documented but not `@[simp]`
   (`CycleClasses.lean` 157–168, 258–266); restate a simp lemma's LHS in
   normal form before tagging it (`Degree1.lean` 970–977).
8. Name the Mathlib twin file before the rename commit and match it
   (`CycleClasses` follows `Algebra/Homology/ShortComplex/ModuleCat.lean` and
   `RepresentationTheory/Homological/GroupHomology/LowDegree.lean`; add one
   `rfl` lemma tying the new object to the library's own functor, as
   `SingularH1.map_eq_singularHomologyFunctor_map` does).
9. Commits: first a provenance baseline (bytes verbatim, SHA-256 of every
   source range in the message, only import/namespace lines changed and each
   named); then one concern per commit (`move`, `rename`, `doc`, `style`, one
   `refactor`), the body saying whether any proof term or statement changed
   ("No proof term changed.") and which gate was run.
10. Generalize only when the twin dictates it and the `Hopf/` consumer
    recovers the original by instantiation (`CycleClasses`: `ℤ` → any ring,
    any universe), in its own commit with the reason.

DO NOT COPY
- the `Authors: PLACEHOLDER` line; write the real author line;
- `(X : Type)` in some blocks and `Type*` in others (`Degree1.lean` 84 vs
  516); pick `Type*` unless a universe constraint forces otherwise, and say
  which;
- linter overrides in the tree; record an import reaching a forbidden
  directory as an open item;
- commit messages citing audits or drafts that are not in the tree;
- theorems without docstrings (`PeriodicLoop.lean` 42–127);
- re-binding a hoisted variable (`Degree1.lean` 982, 1008); helpers after
  their section (`SimplexPaths.lean` 412–421); files without `## References`
  (four of the five).

## Your lanes, in execution order

Each lane: create `lib/<lane>-<slug>` off `lib/textbook-extraction`. Write the
module docstring of each target file first — statement with the exact type of
the headline declaration, reference with theorem number, outline whose steps
name the declarations, `## Main definitions and results` — drafting it in
`Lib/reports/<lane>.md` before any Lean is touched; the correspondence table
(source range → target file → declarations) stays in that report. Then the
provenance-baseline commit: cut the declarations by declaration boundary
(never by raw line) from the census ranges, paste them verbatim into the target
file with the file-level pragmas of the source (`set_option
maxSynthPendingDepth 3`, the `open`/`open scoped` lines, `noncomputable
section`, `universe u v`, the local notations, every `attribute [local
instance …] … in` wrapper), record the SHA-256 of every source range in the
commit message, change only import paths and `namespace` lines and name each
such edit; delete them from `Hopf/`, add `import Lib.…` to each consumer, and
— if a consumer references the old dotted name more than about fifty times —
leave an `export`/`alias` shim in `Hopf/` (transitional namespace rule,
`Lib/README.md`). Then the `doc` commit installing the module docstring and the
`/-! ### … -/` section headers ("No proof term changed."). Then the rename
commit, naming the Mathlib twin file each target follows; a carried pragma is
dropped only in a later commit after a rebuild shows it unnecessary. Statements
never change in your lanes as seen from `Hopf/`; a representation-only
generalization of the `Lib` statement (coefficient ring, universe, binder
hoisting) dictated by the twin is allowed in its own commit with the reason,
provided the `Hopf/` consumer recovers the original by instantiation; if any
other statement must change to compile, stop and record it as an open item for
the Kimi task instead.

### Lane A — singular homology core (Hatcher §2.1–2.2, 2.B) — first, nothing waits on you
- Source: `Hopf/SingularHomology.lean` 85–3835, 3835–4359, 30894–31281;
  `Hopf/SphereTopology.lean` 85–2571, 6624–7310, 13388–13962, 15326–16127,
  16147–18066; `Hopf/Hurewicz.lean` 15792–15994, 23324–23422;
  `Hopf/LCP/CuspFilling.lean` declarations `SingularMayerVietoris.*` 15076–15346;
  `Hopf/DifferentialTopology.lean` 30922–31117 (`SmallChainBiprod`).
- Targets: `Lib/AlgebraicTopology/SingularHomology/{Chains,ModuleHomology,
  MayerVietoris,Subdivision,SmallChains,HomotopyInvariance,Sum,Coproduct,
  CircleProduct,Suspension,Sphere,Naturality,LocalContributions,
  LinearSphereAction,LocalDegree,Augmentation}.lean`,
  `Lib/Topology/Homotopy/Suspension.lean`, `Lib/Topology/OnePointCollapse.lean`,
  `Lib/Algebra/Homology/MayerVietorisShortExact.lean`.
- Mathematics (in words): the singular chain complex of a space, with its free
  basis of singular simplices; the short exact sequence of chain complexes
  0 → C(U ∩ V) → C(U) ⊕ C(V) → C^{U,V}(X) → 0 for two open sets covering X,
  and the resulting Mayer–Vietoris long exact sequence (Hatcher §2.2); the
  barycentric subdivision operator with its chain homotopy and the small
  simplices theorem (Hatcher Prop 2.21); homotopy invariance (Thm 2.10); H₀ of
  a path-connected space is ℤ and detects path components (Prop 2.7); homology
  of disjoint unions and finite coproducts (Prop 2.6); the unreduced suspension
  and the suspension isomorphism, hence H_n(Sⁿ) ≅ ℤ and H_k(Sⁿ) = 0 otherwise
  (Cor 2.14); Künneth for S¹ × X; naturality of the connecting homomorphism and
  its localization over a disjoint family of opens; a linear automorphism acts
  on H_n(Sⁿ) by the sign of its determinant (Prop 2.32–2.33); local degree data
  (Prop 2.30).
- Move type: pure move. Namespaces to rename in the second commit:
  `PeriodTorusHigherHomology` → `SingularHomology`, `CuspCentralHomology` →
  `Suspension`, `ThreefoldHomologyStarCoproduct` → `Coproduct`, `SixSphereCube`
  → `OnePointCollapse`, `FirstHurewicz` → `SingularChains`.
- Consumers to re-route and build: `Hopf.SingularHomology`, `Hopf.SphereTopology`,
  `Hopf.Hurewicz`, `Hopf.LCP.CuspFilling`, `Hopf.LCP.Specialization`,
  `Hopf.LCP.BoundaryTopology`, `Hopf.LCP.IntegralHomology`, `Hopf.Recognition`.
- Top theorems for the axiom probe: `SingularMayerVietoris.exact_at_ambient`,
  `SphereHomology.unitSphere_homology_subsingleton`,
  `Smale.LinearSphereAction.homology_eq_sign_smul`.
- Hazards: `(X : Type)` universe 0 everywhere (keep it); the local instance
  `ThreefoldHomologyStarCoproduct.singularChainsFiniteBiproducts` is attached to
  every declaration of its block; `CuspCentralHomology.instLocal1` supplies the
  quotient topology on the suspension.

### Lane D1 — Morse theory I (Milnor, Morse Theory §2–3; h-cobordism Thm 2.5; Lee Thm 4.5, Cor 5.14, Thm 9.12) — independent of A
- Source: `Hopf/DifferentialTopology.lean` 85–9042, 14780–14981, 18259–19186,

  Flow/HeightTranslating,RegularLevel}.lean`, `Lib/Geometry/Manifold/Morse/{Basic,
  Existence,GradientLike,Handle,HandleAttachment,SublevelSets,Index,
  SurgeryWindows,Reeb}.lean`, `Lib/Topology/Homotopy/{DiskCylinder,CylinderHEP,
  HandleRetraction}.lean`.
- Mathematics: the Morse lemma (a nondegenerate critical point has a chart in
  which f = f(a) + Σ ±yᵢ²; Milnor Morse Theory Lemma 2.2); every compact smooth
  manifold admits a Morse function (h-cobordism Thm 2.5) and a gradient-like
  vector field; a C¹ field on a compact manifold generates a global flow, and a
  C^∞ field has a C^∞ flow (Lee Thm 9.12); a regular level set is a manifold of
  one lower dimension (Lee Cor 5.14); the Morse index is well defined; across a
  band without critical values sublevel sets are homeomorphic and homotopy
  equivalent (Morse Theory Thm 3.1); passing a critical point of index λ attaches
  a λ-handle, up to homotopy equivalence and up to homeomorphism with control on
  the level (Thm 3.2); the handle-attachment exact sequence in homology; Reeb's
  theorem: a closed manifold with a Morse function with two critical points is a
  sphere (Thm 4.1); the disc cylinder I × Dⁿ ≅ D^{n+1} and the homotopy extension
  property of (Dⁿ, S^{n−1}) (Hatcher Prop 0.16); transport of a manifold
  structure along a homeomorphism.
- Move type: pure move. Hazards: `Smale.RegularLevel.chartedSpace` is
  `@[instance_reducible]` and appears as `letI := …` inside theorem statements —
  keep that idiom exactly; `Fact (Module.finrank ℝ … = n + 1)` instances; the
  `Classical.propDecidable` wrappers.
- Consumers: `Hopf.DifferentialTopology`, `Hopf.SingularHomology`,
  `Hopf.SphereTopology`, `Hopf.Recognition`, `Hopf.Final`.
- Axiom probe: `Smale.ManifoldMorse.exists_morse_function`,

  Tubular,Collar}.lean`, `Lib/Geometry/Manifold/Morse/CellStructure.lean`,
  `Lib/Topology/Homotopy/CellAttachment.lean`.
- Mathematics: every compact smooth manifold embeds in some ℝᴺ with injective
  differential; a smooth family of idempotents of constant rank defines a smooth
  vector bundle; the tubular neighbourhood theorem and a smooth retraction onto
  the submanifold; collars of regular levels and compactly supported ambient
  diffeomorphisms moving one level to a nearby one; a handle deformation-retracts
  to its core cell, so attaching a handle is attaching a cell up to homotopy; the
  cell-attachment Mayer–Vietoris cover; every compact smooth manifold has the
  homotopy type of a finite cell complex with one cell per critical point
  (Morse Theory Thm 3.5).
- Consumers: `Hopf.DifferentialTopology`, `Hopf.SingularHomology`,
  `Hopf.SphereTopology`, `Hopf.Recognition`.

  FieldChartGluing}.lean`, `Lib/Analysis/Calculus/IntervalTranslation.lean`.
- Mathematics: time change of a flow by a positive factor; the flow cylinder of a
  regular level and realization of a level isotopy by a modified gradient-like
  field; the cubic model x³/3 + t·x + Σ σᵢyᵢ² and the complete analysis of its
  flow; a smooth Lyapunov function on a band; the First Cancellation Theorem
  (two critical points of adjacent index joined by a unique transverse orbit
  cancel; h-cobordism Thm 5.4); the Rearrangement Theorem (critical values of
  non-interacting critical points can be reset; Thm 4.1) and self-indexing
  Morse functions (Thm 4.8); cancellation of superfluous minima and maxima
  (Thm 8.1) and the duality f ↦ −f; birth of a pair of critical points of
  prescribed adjacent indices.
- Consumers: `Hopf.SingularHomology`, `Hopf.SphereTopology`, `Hopf.Recognition`.
- Axiom probe: `Degree.MorseRearrangement.exists_morse_rearrangement_of_no_connection`,

- Source: `Hopf/LCP/AnalyticFillings.lean` `RiemannMapping.*` 4369–5578 with the
  `_root_.Complex.*` steps 4711–5413 (STOP at 5579: from `triangleDomain` on it is
  project code), `RiemannBoundary.*` and `SchwarzReflection.*` (4409–9121,
  interleaved with project declarations — cut by name), `RiemannSphere.*`
  3581–4019, `TriangleRiemannNormalization.*` 4149–4266, and exactly three

  SchwarzReflection,BoundaryExtension,Mobius,DBar,Cousin,SquareRoot}.lean`,
  `Lib/Geometry/Manifold/Instances/RiemannSphere.lean`,
  `Lib/Geometry/Manifold/Complex/Biholomorph.lean`.
- Mathematics: the Riemann mapping theorem via normal families and the Koebe
  derivative maximization (Ahlfors Ch. 6 §1; Rudin 14.8); Schwarz reflection
  across a line and across an arc of the unit circle; Carathéodory-style
  extension of a disc homeomorphism to the closed disc; Möbius transformations
  of the Riemann sphere, three-point maps, cross-ratio, disc ↔ half-plane; the
  solution of ∂̄u = f by the Cauchy–Green transform and the additive Cousin
  problem on an open cover of ℂ (Forster §13–14; Hörmander I §1.2–1.4);
  holomorphic square roots on simply connected domains when all zeros have
  even order (Rudin 13.11).

  `HolomorphicCousin.exists_normalized_holomorphic_cocycle_solution`,
  `AnalyticRootCover.exists_analytic_square_root_on_of_even_zeros`.
- Note: two of the 31 `_root_` steps duplicate `private` lemmas in Mathlib's
  `Analysis/Complex/RiemannMapping.lean`; keep them (decision Q6) and list them
  in the report as the upstream follow-up.

### Lane I — quotient manifolds, coverings, mapping torus, Wang sequence, split extensions (Forster §1–5; Hatcher §1.3, Ex 2.48) — Wang part after A, the rest independent
- Source (by prefix; ranges in `Lib/EXTRACTION_PLAN.md` §2): `Hopf/LCP/PeriodConstruction.lean`
  `LocalOrbitQuotient`, `OnePointAtlas`, `TwoAffineCharts`, `FreeActionLocus`,

- Mathematics: charts on quotients by properly discontinuous and free actions,
  the free locus, one-point compactification of a Riemann surface, ℙ¹ from two
  affine charts, E/L for a discrete lattice as a Lie group; a covering quotient
  with holomorphic deck action is a manifold; the diagonal quotient (B × F)/G
  as a fibre bundle and its π₁ exact sequence; a principal bundle glued from two
  opens by one transition function and its monodromy; a split extension is a
  semidirect product; the mapping torus, its two-open cover, and the Wang exact
  sequence (Hatcher Ex 2.48); deformation retraction onto a sublevel set and
  patching of local collapses.
- Consumers: `Hopf.LCP.LocalModels`, `Hopf.LCP.CuspFilling`, `Hopf.LCP.Specialization`,
  `Hopf.LCP.PeriodConstruction`, `Hopf.LCP.AnalyticFillings`, `Hopf.LCP.GlobalAssembly`,

### Lane B — fundamental group, van Kampen, simply connected spheres (Hatcher Thm 1.20, Prop 1.14) — after A; last
- Source: `Hopf/Hurewicz.lean` 545–1348, 1353–1466; `Hopf/SingularHomology.lean`
  18734–19048; `Hopf/LCP/BoundaryTopology.lean` `FundamentalGroupVanKampen.*`
  (114 declarations) and `TriangleRegularBaseFundamentalGroup.*` 8622–8767.

  TwoSimplyConnectedCover}.lean`, `Lib/Topology/Homotopy/{SuspensionSimplyConnected,
  LoopSubdivision}.lean`, `Lib/AlgebraicTopology/FundamentalGroupoid/SimplyConnectedSphere.lean`.
- Mathematics: a space covered by simply connected open sets through a common
  point with path-connected pairwise intersections is simply connected; the
  Seifert–van Kampen theorem for a two-open cover in pushout form, including the
  uniqueness half; a loop is homotopic to a concatenation of loops each inside
  one member of an open cover; the unreduced suspension of a path-connected
  space, hence every sphere of dimension ≥ 2, is simply connected.
- Consumers: `Hopf.Hurewicz`, `Hopf.SingularHomology`, `Hopf.LCP.BoundaryTopology`,
  `Hopf.Recognition`.
- Axiom probe: `simplyConnectedSpace_of_open_cover`,
  `FundamentalGroupVanKampen.TwoOpenCover.pushoutEquiv`.
- Note: the sphere and loop-subdivision blocks are adapted from Mathlib PR #28246;
  say so in the docstrings; an equivalent formalization of the van Kampen block
  exists outside this tree (decision Q4) — move as-is and note it in the report.

## OUT OF SCOPE (binding)
- Lanes C, E2, F, G, J (the Kimi task): do not touch `*Hurewicz.*` blocks
  other than the two listed under lane A, nothing in `Hopf/SingularHomology.lean`
  16000–28261, nothing in `Hopf/Recognition.lean` other than the ranges listed
  above, no `PeriodTorusHigherHomology` torus/Pontryagin/exterior blocks.
- Anything under `Hopf/LCP/` that is not named above by prefix and range.
- Changing the statement of any declaration under `Hopf/`, including
  `mathoverflow_1973`, `Degree.threefoldHomotopyEquiv`,
  `Smale.homeomorphic_sixSphere_of_homotopySixSphere`.
- Editing `lean-protocol.md`, `scripts/lib_stock_prefixes.txt` (except to
  remove an entry whose declarations are all gone), Mathlib, `lakefile.toml`.

## Cross-model ordering
- Kimi's lane C starts as soon as your lane A has landed on
  `lib/textbook-extraction`; the F lane (Muse seat) waits for your A, D1, D2, E1 (and its own
  E2); J (Muse seat) waits for your A. Land A first and announce it in
  `Lib/reports/A.md`.
- While blocked (D2 waits for D1; E1 waits for D2; I's Wang part waits for A),
  take the next independent lane: order A → D1 → H → D2 → I → E1 → B.

## Build discipline (the box is shared — `ps` first)
- `lake exe cache get` before anything; never build Mathlib from source; never
  `lake clean`.
- Build only the touched modules and their consumers: `lake build Lib.<Module>`,
  then `lake build Hopf.<Consumer>` for the consumers listed per lane; once per
  lane `lake build Hopf.Final` then `lake build Solution` (hours; schedule it).
- Record wall-clock time of every `lake build` in the lane report.
- `python3 scripts/lib_stock_census.py --check` before every commit;
  `--update` after every extraction commit; commit the lowered baseline.
- Axiom probe: append the lane's top theorems to `Lib/AxiomAudit.lean` and run
  `lake env lean Lib/AxiomAudit.lean`.
- Comparator: `lake exe comparator comparator/config.json` once per lane.

## Commit conventions
- Branch `lib/<lane>-<slug>`; message prefix `lib(<lane>):`; one commit per
  `Lib` file or per green unit; the rename commit separate (`lib(<lane>): rename …`).
- Kinds after the prefix: `baseline` (bytes verbatim, source SHA-256s in the
  message, only import/namespace lines changed and named), `move`, `rename`,
  `doc`, `style`, `refactor`; the body states whether any proof term or
  statement changed and which gate was run.
- No trailers; attribution is handled by the repository owner's instructions.
- NEVER git push.

## Report (per lane, committed)
`Lib/reports/<lane>.md`: what moved (source ranges → target files, declaration
counts), consumers re-routed (with shims listed), census number before / after,
the `#print axioms` output verbatim, build wall times, the Mathlib twin file per
target, the count of public declarations without a docstring (target 0), the
lint output, open items (statements that would have to change, declarations
left behind, upstream follow-ups, the questions a Mathlib reviewer would ask:
imports reaching forbidden directories, universe choices). An honest
obstruction (a block that does not move without a statement change) is a valid
deliverable: leave it in `Hopf/`, record the exact declaration and reason.
