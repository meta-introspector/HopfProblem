# Concrete cyclic-average certificates

This proof-owned adapter derives the concrete rational matrix certificates from the reusable
`Module.End` cyclic-averaging API in `Lib.LinearAlgebra.CyclicAverage`.

No assertion about the existence of a complex structure on the six-sphere is made here; the
analytic hypotheses of the proposed construction lie outside the scope of this module.
