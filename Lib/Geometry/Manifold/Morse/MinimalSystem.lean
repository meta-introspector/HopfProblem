# Homotopy six-sphere data: connectivity and homology vanishing

`SixSphere` is the round unit sphere in `ℝ⁷`. A space homotopy equivalent to it
inherits its basic invariants: `simplyConnectedSpace_of_homotopySixSphere` and
`pathConnectedSpace_of_homotopySixSphere` give simple and path connectivity, and
`homotopySixSphere_homology_subsingleton` gives `Subsingleton` singular homology in
every degree other than `0` and `6` (transported through
`SingularHomology.homotopyEquivHomologyEquiv` from
`SphereHomology.unitSphere_homology_subsingleton`).

This is the hypothesis-generation input for the six-dimensional recognition
theorem (Smale 1961, Theorem A): the two-critical-point Morse conclusion is
assembled over this data, not inside this file.

## Main declarations

* `SixSphere` : the unit sphere in `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 7)`.
* `simplyConnectedSpace_of_homotopySixSphere`,
  `pathConnectedSpace_of_homotopySixSphere` : connectivity of a homotopy `S⁶`.
* `homotopySixSphere_homology_subsingleton` : `Hₖ(M)` is a subsingleton for
  `k ∉ {0, 6}` when `M ≃ₕ SixSphere`.

## References

* [John Milnor, *Lectures on the h-cobordism theorem*][milnor65], Ch. 9
  (the recognition application this data feeds).

## Twin

No Mathlib counterpart exists; the declarations are upstream-shaped but have no
Mathlib file to converge to.
