# C13 bootstrap — typed boundary

Canonical source: `Lib/docs/C.md`, §15, the bootstrap induction paragraph. The complete Hurewicz equivalence is proved before this induction: at each degree k, the lower homotopy groups are supplied by strong induction and the target homology group vanishes. This is not an induction on the proof of the Hurewicz theorem itself.

Repository baseline: `0a3b870`, branch `lib/C-10-boundary`. Both nodes are FREE. Ordered outputs: C13.1, C13.2. Intended consumer: the general Hopf degree theorem and the existing `Degree.Sphere.piTwo_subsingleton` through `piFive_subsingleton` adapters.

## C13.1

  return_seam: Axis 5 for elaboration; Axis 1 if strong induction fails to supply a mathematical input

## C13.2

  class: FREE

  imports: Lib.AlgebraicTopology.Hurewicz.CubeSphere, Lib.AlgebraicTopology.FundamentalGroupoid.SimplyConnectedSphere, Lib.AlgebraicTopology.SingularHomology.SphereHomology
  dependencies: C13.1, EuclideanSphere.simplyConnectedSpace, SphereHomology.unitSphere_homology_subsingleton
  representation: Degree.SphereCube.Sphere n = SphereHomology.UnitSphere n by rfl; n is at least 3 under the supplied hypotheses
  destination: Lib/AlgebraicTopology/Hurewicz/HopfDegree.lean, Mathoverflow1973.HigherHurewicz.sphere_pi_subsingleton_of_lt

## Interface and independent review

The provider and importing consumer compiled at `0a3b870` using Lean v4.33.0:

```
PATH=/tmp/shared-lean-copy/toolchain-v4.33.0/bin:$PATH lake env lean -o C13_InterfaceCheck.olean C13_InterfaceCheck.lean
LEAN_PATH=.:$LEAN_PATH PATH=/tmp/shared-lean-copy/toolchain-v4.33.0/bin:$PATH lake env lean C13_InterfaceConsumerCheck.lean
```

Both exit statuses were 0. Two planned output signatures, four existing API checks, and the sphere-model definitional equality elaborated. Both outputs were visible to the separate consumer. Evidence: `logs/C/C13-interface-provider.log` and `logs/C/C13-interface-consumer.log`.

Independent interface reviewer: Devin implementation agent; coordinating review: Devin. Verdict: GO for the two signatures with plain-import visibility. A `module`/`public import` header cannot yet be used: the imported legacy modules are non-module files. The final successful probes use exactly the plain-import context specified above. No mathematical hypothesis was changed. The temporary axioms used to elaborate signatures are not production declarations and must be removed before committing this boundary.
