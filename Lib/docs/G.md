$\mathrm{finrank}\, E = 6$; the five spellings of $S^6$ consolidate on
`Metric.sphere (0 : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 7)) 1`; the vestigial `[SecondCountableTopology M]`
on the current headline wrapper is dropped in the `Lib/` statement (it is implied by
compactness, and the proof never uses it — the inner chain does not take it). The
generalization to $n \geq 5$ is the follow-up lane G′ and is **not** started here.

# Axis 1 — the textbook proof

## 1. The theorem

**Theorem (Smale 1961, Theorem A at $n = 6$).** *Let $E$ be a 6-dimensional finite-dimensional
real normed space and $M$ a compact, Hausdorff, smooth ($C^\infty$) manifold without boundary modeled on $E$.
If $M$ is homotopy equivalent to the 6-sphere $S^6$, then $M$ is homeomorphic to $S^6$.*

Remarks. (a) The hypothesis "homotopy equivalent" is used through three corollaries: $M$ is
path connected; $M$ is simply connected ($\pi_1 M = 0$); and $M$ has the homology of $S^6$:
$\widetilde H_k(M) = 0$ for $k \neq 6$ and $H_6(M) \cong \mathbb{Z}$. (b) The conclusion is
*homeomorphism*, not diffeomorphism: the argument produces a two-disc decomposition and
invokes Reeb's theorem; the smooth structure is used only to run Morse theory. (c) In the
library the target sphere is the unit sphere of $\mathbb{R}^7$,
`Metric.sphere (0 : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 7)) 1`, and the file's docstring records the precise
relation to Mathlib's
`proof_wanted ContinuousMap.HomotopyEquiv.nonempty_homeomorph_sphere` (topological, every $n$,
Euclidean model, no explicit compactness): our theorem establishes the smooth compact
$n = 6$ case, after transport along a linear equivalence of model spaces. It does not
strengthen the general topological statement.

## 2. The strategy

Reeb's theorem (lane D1): a compact smooth $n$-manifold admitting a smooth function with
exactly two critical points is homeomorphic to $S^n$ (the sublevel set below a middle regular
value is a disc, by the flow and the regular-interval theorem; the complementary superlevel is
a disc by the same applied to $-f$; a manifold glued from two discs along their common boundary
sphere is homeomorphic to the sphere).

So the task is: *produce a smooth function on $M$ with exactly two critical points.* This is
done by handle elimination from an arbitrary Morse function, using the hypotheses of simple
connectivity and the homology of a sphere. The elimination has three campaigns:

1. **Indices 0 and 6** — connectedness leaves one index-0 critical point (a minimum) and one
   index-6 point (a maximum): a minimal system has one of each (§3).
2. **Indices 1 and 5** — the handle trade: on a simply connected manifold of dimension
   $n \geq 6$ an index-1 handle can be traded for an index-3 handle (birth a cancelling
   $(2,3)$-pair, then cancel the $(1,2)$-pair); dually for index 5. Minimality forbids the
   trade's net effect, so no index-1 or index-5 handles exist in a minimal system (§4).
3. **Indices 2, 3, 4** — the middle matrix campaign: the index-2/index-3 handles contribute a
   boundary matrix which, because $M$ is a homology sphere, presents the trivial group; integer
   reduction (lane F) turns it into a matrix with a unit entry; the Whitney trick (lane F)
   turns the unit into a single geometric intersection point; the first cancellation theorem
   (lane E1) removes the pair — contradicting minimality unless no middle handles exist.
   Index 4 is index 2 of $-f$, so indices 2, 3, 4 all vanish (§5).

Then $f$ has only the minimum and the maximum, and Reeb concludes (§6).

## 3. Minimal ordered systems

A Morse function $f \colon M \to \mathbb{R}$ with distinct critical values, ordered so that
values increase with the index (*ordered*), exists by lanes D1 (existence of Morse functions)
and E1 (rearrangement: the indices can be sorted without changing the critical set; an
*excellent* system additionally separates all critical values — the code's
`exists_index_ordered_morse_system_preserving_critical_points`, which preserves the critical
set, all indices, and all index counts).

**Existence of the minima.** Choose $f$ *minimal*: the set of critical-point counts of
excellent Morse functions on $M$ is a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$, so it has a least
element attained by some $f$ (the code's `exists_minimal_excellent_morse_system` performs
this `Nat.find`; the comparison class is *every* smooth Morse $g$ with distinct critical
values, ordered or not). Then order $f$ by the rearrangement above — ordering preserves the
count, so minimality is retained — and subject to the minimal count choose $f$
*outer-index-minimal*: at $n=6$, minimize the index-$1$ + index-$5$ count among **all
excellent Morse functions with the minimum total count**, whether ordered or not. Order
the chosen function afterward; rearrangement preserves both the total and each index
count, so both minimality properties survive (`exists_outer_index_minimal_ordered_morse_system`).
This comparison class includes the excellent, not necessarily ordered, output of the trade.

**Unique minimum.** Compactness and nonemptiness give a global minimum, whose Morse
index is zero. If there is more than one index-0 point, the component bookkeeping for
the handle decomposition of the connected manifold supplies an index-1 point $q$ whose
two attaching ends lie in different path components of its lower sublevel
(`exists_native_one_handle_joining_components`). This is a statement about attaching
components, not yet about the endpoints of the given flow. Realizing the branches
(`realize_one_handle_minimum_branches`) produces a compatible gradient-like field whose
two ends descend to distinct minima $p,r$, with no other critical endpoints from $q$.
Their values are distinct. Choose the higher minimum; the branch data gives its unique
connecting orbit from $q$. A flow-preserving rearrangement makes this pair consecutive
in critical value, retaining the critical set, indices and excellent Morse data.
The isolated $(0,1)$ cancellation then removes the pair; surviving critical germs retain
distinct critical values (`cancel_realized_higher_minimum`). The result is an excellent Morse function with exactly
two fewer critical points (`exists_excellent_morse_reduction_of_multiple_minima`),
contradicting minimality (`minimal_excellent_morse_forbids_pair_removal`). Hence
`nativeMorseCount E f 0 = 1` (`minimal_excellent_morse_minimum_count_one`); applied to $-f$,
whose indices are $n - \lambda$, `nativeMorseCount E f n = 1` — together
`minimal_excellent_morse_extreme_counts_one`, and at $n = 6$ this is one minimum and one
maximum.

## 4. Trading away index 1 (Milnor Thm. 8.1 at $n = 6$)

**The birth.** In a level band free of critical points, the birth theorem (lane E1) creates an
*excellent* cancelling pair of indices $(2, 3)$: a local cubic model with a single
intersection between the new attaching and belt spheres, embedded by the E2 machinery.

**The trade.** Suppose an index-1 critical point $q$ exists. Its attaching sphere is $S^0$.
The relevant regular cut $a$ is **after the original index-2 point region used by the
argument and before the index-3 points**, not below the index-2 handles: 2-handles can kill
fundamental-group generators, so a level below them need not be simply connected. The
source's cut has index at most $2$ below and at least $3$ above (`hlow`/`hhigh`), with $q$
below the cut and a critical-free band above it (the `Ioo a u` hypothesis) containing a
basepoint `x`. The trade proceeds in two steps:

* **Birth above the cut** (`exists_excellent_indexed_morse_birth` at $k = 2$): inside the
  band, birth an excellent cancelling $(2,3)$-pair $b_2, b_3$. The birth changes nothing at
  or below the cut: the level $f = a$ is preserved verbatim (`heq : ∀ y, g y = a ↔ f y = a`,
  supplied by `birth_preserves_lower_levels` at SphereTopology:6391 (conclusion :6401); the `hsub`/`hlevel`
  hypotheses belong to `cancel_from_preserved_unit_belt_cut`, Recognition:6646–6647), the cut stays regular for the new function (`hgr`), the unique minimum survives
  (`birth_preserves_unique_index_zero`), and there is a value gap below $b_2$ (`hgap`).
* **Cancellation at the unchanged cut**
  (`cancel_one_two_pair_at_unchanged_cut_of_unique_minimum`): the born 2-handle's attaching
  circle is placed, in the preserved level $f^{-1}(a)$, to meet the belt sphere of the
  1-handle $q$ transversely in a single point, and the first cancellation theorem removes
  the $(1,2)$-pair $(q, b_2)$ using this preserved cut as input. The final cancellation
  may change the function at the cut; its output promises pair removal and surviving
  indices, not equality of the final level with the original one. The placement is the
  substantive geometric content: the source realizes the two branches of the unique
  minimum's 1-handle (`realize_unique_minimum_one_handle_branches`), produces flow windows
  avoiding the level (`exists_same_flow_windows_avoiding_level`), identifies the attaching
  branches along the common flow (`attaching_branches_of_same_flow`), then runs the
  middle-belt loop construction (`exists_transverse_middle_belt_loop`,
  SphereTopology:5551) and places the born handle's attaching circle through it
  (`exists_new_attaching_circle_placement`, SphereTopology:6553;
  `exists_transverse_sheet_of_circle_placement`, SphereTopology:5699) — the two distinct
  unit-sphere points of the 1-handle's one-dimensional negative-coordinate space
  (`exists_distinct_unitSphere_points_of_finrank_one`, SphereTopology:7100) supply the
  branch separation inside that construction, not the transverse hit by themselves —
  and feeds the transverse level data to
  `cancel_one_two_pair_at_preserved_middle_cut`
  (`exists_handle_trade_transverse_level_data` +
  `cancel_transverse_pair_after_flow_preserving_descent`).

Net effect (`exists_one_to_three_handle_trade`): an excellent Morse function $h$ with the
same total count, `count 1` decreased by one, `count 3` increased by one, all other index
counts unchanged — the born $b_3$ survives as the new index-3 point.

**Minimality closes.** In an outer-index-minimal system the trade lowers the (index-1 +
index-5) count while keeping the total count fixed — a contradiction. Hence no index-1 points;
applying the same to $-f$ (whose indices are $6 - \lambda$, and whose minimality properties
transport by the duality lemmas), no index-5 points. $\square$

## 5. The middle campaign (indices 2, 3, 4)

Now $f$ has indices $0, 2, 3, 4, 6$ only. Choose the regular level $N$ separating index 2 from
index 3. The relevant homology: the sublevel $M_{\leq a}$ up through the index-2 handles has
$H_2$ free on the 2-handle cores (handle homology, lane D2/E1), and the attaching classes of
the index-3 handles give the *middle matrix* $M_3$: an $r \times c$ integer matrix ($r$ the
number of 2-handles, $c$ the number of 3-handles), equal — by lane F's intersection-number
theorem — to the matrix of signed intersection numbers of belt spheres $S^{3}$ (of the
2-handles) with attaching spheres $S^{2}$ (of the 3-handles) in the 5-dimensional level $N$.

**Vanishing.** Handles of index at least 4 do not change $H_2$, so the sublevel just
after all index-3 handles has the same $H_2$ as $M$, namely zero. The handle chain complex
therefore gives a surjection $M_3 : \mathbb Z^c \to \mathbb Z^r$. If $r>0$, select a
primitive coordinate functional on $\mathbb Z^r$; its composite with $M_3$ is a primitive
integer row. Concretely, the source takes the primitive functional supplied by the
**last index-two handle's collapse coordinate** — `last_index_two_collapse_is_primitive`
(Recognition:6247–6282) produces it together with the retained lower-level contractions —
and makes the selected index-three point first via
`consecutive_last_two_first_three` (Recognition:6743, applied at
Recognition:6874 inside `cancel_from_complete_middle_family`, whose output
`hconsecutive` is passed to `cancel_from_preserved_unit_belt_cut` at :6900), which is what makes the cancelling pair consecutive. Elementary column
operations produce a unit in that row and are realized geometrically by slides of the
3-handles.

The belt sphere of a 2-handle is $S^3$, and the attaching sphere of a 3-handle is $S^2$,
in the 5-dimensional regular level $N$. **The Whitney step needs more than ambient simple
connectivity.** Milnor's Theorem 6.6, with the moving sheet of dimension $2$ and the fixed
sheet of dimension $3$, requires injectivity of
$\pi_1(N \smallsetminus \text{fixed sheet}) \to \pi_1(N)$ in addition to the contractible
Whitney loop and orientation hypotheses. On orientations: $M$ is simply connected, hence
orientable; the regular hypersurface $N$ inherits an orientation and the embedded spheres
are orientable, so the framed Whitney move's orientation bookkeeping is available data,
not a missing assumption on $M$. The required input is supplied by the handle
structure as follows — this is the mechanism the code implements, replacing ambient
simple connectivity with a *lower-level* one.

* **Lower-level circle contractions.** In an ordered system with one minimum and no
  index-1 points, the noninitial handles preceding the chosen index-2 point have index
  2. Start with the first sublevel disk, whose boundary is $S^5$, and induct through
  those handles and the intervening regular intervals. The more general induction
  allows indices 2 and 3 (`lower_circle_nullhomotopies_of_middle_indices`,
  SphereTopology:4228); its specialization is
  `lower_circle_nullhomotopies_of_ordered_native_indices` (SphereTopology:4333).
  The induction step uses the complement argument below, then moves an arbitrary
  upper-level circle off the belt and contracts it in that complement.
* **Contract the disk in the old complement, then transport it.** For an index-$k$
  handle, the old complement is the lower level minus the attaching $S^{k-1}$; the
  new complement is the upper level minus the belt $S^{5-k}$. The surgery supplies
  a homeomorphism between these complements. A circle in the old complement contracts
  in the lower level. Relative general position moves the entire contracting disk
  off the attaching sphere while fixing its boundary: the required inequality is
  $2+(k-1)<5$, which holds for $k=2,3$. Transport this nullhomotopy through the
  complement homeomorphism to obtain a contraction in the new complement. To prove
  contractions for arbitrary circles in the upper level, first move the circle off
  its belt using $1+(5-k)<5$. Circle avoidance and disk avoidance are distinct steps.
  The source implements disk avoidance in `ImageComplement.circle_nullhomotopies`
  (Morse/SurgeryWindows.lean:767), complement transport in
  `SurgeryBoundaryPair.beltComplement_circle_nullhomotopies_of_sphere_dimension`
  (Morse/SurgeryWindows.lean:782), and the upper-boundary step in `newBoundary_circle_nullhomotopies` (Morse/SurgeryWindows.lean:1486).
  For the chosen index-2 handle, the attaching sphere is $S^1$ and $2+1<5$; the belt
  is $S^3$, the boundary of the four-dimensional **cocore**, not of the descending
  two-dimensional core disk.
* **Keep regular-cut transport separate.** `exists_native_belt_cut_family`
  (Recognition:6283) collects the lower-level contractions from
  `last_index_two_collapse_is_primitive` (Recognition:6247) and moves the attaching family and
  its matrix through a critical-free band between two cuts **above** the chosen
  critical value. It preserves the matrix and surjectivity. This is not the
  old/new complement homeomorphism across the handle.
* **Feed the Whitney disk construction.** The lower-level hypothesis
  `hnull : ∀ δ : C(S¹, LowerLevel p), ∃ z, δ ~ const z` is sufficient input, not
  literally the complement injectivity proposition. The signed-chart theorem
  `surgery_beltComplement_circle_nullhomotopies` (Morse/SurgeryWindows.lean:879) converts it
  to contractions of all circles in the belt complement by the preceding argument.
  `MorseSurgeryData.nonempty_belt_tubularBigon` (SingularHomology:10206, called at
  SingularHomology:10342) passes those contractions to the relative tubular-bigon construction.
  With the smooth embedded attaching sphere, transverse data and a unit signed
  intersection count, the Whitney cancellation removes opposite-sign pairs until
  a single transverse intersection remains. `cancel_from_complete_middle_family`
  (Recognition:6786) obtains the unit by slides and places the selected index-3 point
  first; `cancel_from_preserved_unit_belt_cut` (Recognition:6632) uses the retained lower-level
  input, transported unit and flow data to perform the final pair cancellation.

Once this input is in place, the unit gives one transverse geometric intersection and
the first cancellation theorem removes the $(2,3)$ pair. This lowers the total critical
count, contradicting minimality when $r>0$. Thus there are no index-2 handles; surjectivity
alone does **not** eliminate the remaining index-3 handles.

**Index 4** is index 2 of $-f$: the same campaign on $-f$ kills index 4.
Only then does $H_3(M)=0$ force the index-3 count to vanish: the handle chain groups in
degrees 2 and 4 are zero, so $H_3(M)$ is the free group on the remaining 3-handles.
The source's complete-block matrix/count argument implements this final step. There are
then exactly two critical points. $\square$

## 6. The Reeb conclusion

The surviving minimal system has exactly two critical points: the unique minimum (index 0) and
the unique maximum (index 6). By Reeb's theorem (lane D1:
`ManifoldMorse.nonempty_homeomorphSphere_of_two_critical_points`, via the two-disc
decomposition: sublevel discs from the signed Morse charts, glued along the boundary sphere),
$M$ is homeomorphic to the sphere of dimension $\mathrm{finrank}\, E = 6$ — the unit sphere of
$\mathbb{R}^7$ in the consolidated spelling. $\square$

## 7. What is generalized and what is not

Generalized (per Q1): the model space — the whole chain takes an arbitrary
finite-dimensional real normed space $E$ with $\mathrm{finrank}\, E = 6$ already (the code's
signatures are `(E : Type) [NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace ℝ E] [FiniteDimensional ℝ E]`;
no inner product is used anywhere in the chain), and the `Lib/` statement drops the vestigial
`[SecondCountableTopology M]` of the current wrapper (Proof/Recognition.lean:1011 — the inner chain
never uses it; a compact smooth Hausdorff manifold is second countable anyway, so the wrapper
loses no content). The five spellings of $S^6$
(`SphereHomology.UnitSphere 6`, `Hemisphere.Sphere 6`, `SixSphere` (MinimalSystem.lean:60),
`MetricSixSphere` (Proof/Recognition.lean:270), `SixSphereCube.StandardSphere`), all definitionally `Metric.sphere (0 : EuclideanSpace ℝ
(Fin 7)) 1`, consolidate on that spelling in the `Lib/` file; the `Hopf/` consumer keeps its
statement verbatim (the re-routing is definitional).

Not generalized: $n = 6$ stays. The $n \geq 5$ form (lane G′) needs lane F at full generality
*and* the middle-index range $2 \leq k \leq n - 2$ replacing the $n = 6$ coincidence "middle
indices $= \{2, 3, 4\}$ and index 4 is index 2 of $-f$". Do not start it.

Pure lemmas (no manifold content) — these are the hypothesis-generation half of the headline's
`(e : M ≃ₕ S⁶)` input; **landed** at `Morse/MinimalSystem.lean:63/68/73` (the
`SecondCountableTopology`-free forms as shown). The `≃ₕ SixSphere` spelling consolidates to
`≃ₕ Metric.sphere (0 : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 7)) 1` (defeq — `SixSphere` is that sphere).

**Row G2a (preliminary minimal ordered systems).** Existence/minimality tower;
the extreme-count proof uses the reviewed (0,1)-cancellation seam. Its surgical helpers
must be supplied by the dependency census rather than treated as absent. Complete

`exists_minimal_excellent_morse_system` is the textbook "minimal Morse function" input
(Faudree: an *excellent* Morse function minimising critical-point count); the other three
refine it — index ordering, `count 0 = count dim = 1` (single min/max, §3 below), and
outer-index minimality among equal critical-cardinality competitors.

`exists_canonical_middle_family` supplies a family with the same ranges and a pointwise
flow-orbit parametrization of the native attaching spheres; it does not supply a unit
column. `canonical_middle_matrix_surjective` derives matrix surjectivity from the span
of the middle-section classes. The later `exists_primitive_functional_unit` supplies
the unit after handle slides. The adjacent source helper
`AdaptedWindows.no_connection_above_canonical_cut` (Recognition.lean:1349) is not an additional
promised G4 output; its dependency ownership remains part of the helper census.

`exists_primitive_functional_unit` is the surjectivity→integral-primitive step (F11's
slide machinery consumed), `exists_first_middle_pivot` the position-zero pivot, the
`exists_native_belt_cut_family`/`cancel_from_preserved_unit_belt_cut` pair the
regular-cut transport and cancellation interfaces (§5), and
`cancel_from_complete_middle_family` the complete-block blocker. The three count
theorems are the elimination conclusions in source order: index 2, index 4 (dual
function −f), then index 3 via H₃ = 0 with the middle chain groups already zeroed —
`ordered_no_middle_indices_count_two` takes the vanishing counts at indices 1, 2, 4
and 5, and uses complete blocks and equal middle-matrix sizes to conclude the index-3
count is zero and the total count is two.

**Ledger notes.**

* *Namespaces.* All decls sit in `namespace Mathoverflow1973`; the dotted prefixes
  (`MorseCancellation.`, `AdaptedWindows.`, `ManifoldMorse.SurgeryWindows.`)
  are the actual namespaces — no bare name in this table resolves without one.
* *`Type` vs `Type*`.* Preserve the elaborated universes during extraction. The chain mixes
  `(E : Type) (M : Type)` (the Recognition-side homotopy-sphere chain) with polymorphic
  declarations such as `exists_minimal_excellent_morse_system` and Reeb. The current
  `SingularMayerVietoris.SingularHomology` takes spaces in `Type`; changing all binders to
  `Type*` is not a representation-only rename and requires a separate typed design/probe.
* *Sphere spellings.* Every `M ≃ₕ SixSphere` / `M ≃ₜ SixSphere` /
  `Hemisphere.Sphere n` occurrence consolidates to the `Metric.sphere` spelling where
  defeq permits; `Hemisphere.Sphere 2`-typed attaching maps (the `γ` binders) are part of the
  native family interface and stay as-is — the consolidation applies to the *theorem*
  statements' sphere, not to internal attaching-sphere types.
* *Instances.* `[SecondCountableTopology M]` appears only on the headline wrapper; the Lib
  theorem drops it (see §7 and open item 2). All other instance sets move verbatim.
* *Universe/instance gotcha recorded by the map:* `(4)`'s `Nonempty (M ≃ₜ Hemisphere.Sphere
  (finrank ℝ E))` is what the `change … ; rw [hdim]` in `(2)` resolves — the Lib file must
  keep that definitional chain intact when consolidating spellings.

# Open items, seams, probes

1. **Seams (blocking).** Lane G starts after C and F land (per the DAG). The ledger rows are
   then exact; probes: `lake env lean
   Lib/Geometry/Manifold/PoincareConjecture/G_InterfaceCheck.lean` + consumer probe; receipt at
   `Lib/docs/G-INTERFACE_RECEIPT.md`.
2. **The vestigial instance.** Dropping `[SecondCountableTopology M]` in the Lib statement is
   authorized by the task; the Hopf wrapper keeps it (statement unchanged); record both in the
   lane report.
3. **Sphere consolidation.** The five spellings collapse to the `Metric.sphere (0 :
   EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 7)) 1` spelling; the consumer-side abbrevs stay as local notation in
   `Hopf/` until the final cleanup; `Hopf/Final.lean`'s own `unitSphere` abbrev is a consumer
   detail, unchanged.
4. **The Mathlib `proof_wanted` relation** goes into the `Smale.lean` module docstring verbatim
   as in §1 remark (c).
5. **Review.** The initial independent review is `Lib/docs/G-stage2-astra-review.md`;
   the `bd9c393` re-review is `Lib/docs/G-stage2-astra-review2.md`. Its identified
   narrative and ledger corrections are applied here, awaiting independent acceptance.
   The G2a/G2b split was accepted in that re-review. The helper dependency census and
   production provider/consumer certification remain separate obligations. Muse's
   `G-stage2-review.md` is self-review, not independent certification.
6. **GLM-lane overlap discovered after landing A–D2/H/I:** lane E2's source ranges were largely
   swept into GLM's `Lib/Geometry/Manifold/Morse/SurgeryWindows.lean` (now 1,983 lines after
   the post-integration split; the two cited declarations moved to
   `Lib/Geometry/Manifold/Immersion/Relative.lean:2017` and
   `Lib/Geometry/Manifold/Morse/Rearrangement.lean:2723` respectively). Lane E2's Lean work is therefore a
   Lib-internal *split* of that file (plus the generalization G-E2), not a Hopf→Lib move;
   lane F's sources remain in `Hopf/` (verified: `TubularBigon`, `primitive_row_*` unmoved).
   This affects E2/F placement timing, not this lane's content.
