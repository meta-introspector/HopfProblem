# Axis 1 — the textbook proofs

## 1. The theorems

**Theorem A (homology of the torus; Hatcher §3.B and Example 3.16, homology form).**
Let $T^r = (S^1)^r$ be the product $r$-torus. Then $H_n(T^r;\mathbb{Z})$ is free abelian of rank
$\binom{r}{n}$, and the Pontryagin (exterior) map
$$\wedge^n H_1(T^r;\mathbb{Z}) \longrightarrow H_n(T^r;\mathbb{Z}), \qquad
a_1 \wedge \dots \wedge a_n \longmapsto a_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot a_n,$$
is an isomorphism for every $n \geq 0$.

**Theorem B (the circle splitting; the trivial Wang sequence).**
For every space $Y$ and every $n$ there is a natural short exact sequence, split by the cross
product with the positive generator $[S^1] \in H_1(S^1)$,
$$0 \longrightarrow H_{n+1}(Y) \xrightarrow{\;\mathrm{incl}_{x_0*}\;}
H_{n+1}(S^1 \times Y) \xrightarrow{\;\partial\;} H_n(Y) \longrightarrow 0,$$
where $\mathrm{incl}_{x_0} \colon Y \to S^1 \times Y$, $y \mapsto (x_0, y)$ is a slice
inclusion (a section of the projection $\mathrm{pr}_2$). Then
$H_{n+1}(S^1 \times Y) \cong H_{n+1}(Y) \oplus H_n(Y)$, with the second summand embedded by
$b \mapsto [S^1] \times b$. (This is the Wang sequence of the trivial mapping torus — the
fibration $Y \to S^1 \times Y \to S^1$ with identity monodromy, i.e. Hatcher Ex. 2.48 with
$f = \mathrm{id}$, where $1 - f_* = 0$; equivalently the Gysin sequence of the trivial circle
bundle, $e = 0$.)

**Theorem C (Pontryagin product; Hatcher §3.C).** For a topological abelian group $G$, singular
homology $H_*(G;\mathbb{Z})$ carries an associative, unital, graded-commutative ring structure
$$a \cdot b := \mu_*(a \times b), \qquad \mu \colon G \times G \to G \text{ the addition},$$
with $a \cdot b = (-1)^{pq}\, b \cdot a$ for $a \in H_p$, $b \in H_q$, and the class of the
identity point as unit. If $H_2(G)$ has no $2$-torsion, the product on $H_1$ is strictly
alternating ($a \cdot a = 0$) and induces maps
$\wedge^n H_1(G) \to H_n(G)$ for every $n$.

**Theorem D (exterior coordinates; the minor formula).** The standard basis
$(e_1, \dots, e_m)$ of $\mathbb{Z}^m$ gives the basis of $\wedge^n \mathbb{Z}^m$ indexed by
$n$-element subsets $s = \{i_1 < \dots < i_n\}$, $e_s := e_{i_1} \wedge \dots \wedge e_{i_n}$.
For an integer matrix $A \in \mathrm{M}_m(\mathbb{Z})$, the induced map $\wedge^n A$ has, in
these bases, the $(s, t)$-entry
$$\big(\wedge^n A\big)_{s, t} \ =\ \det A_{s, t},$$
the determinant of the $n \times n$ submatrix on rows $s$ and columns $t$ (the
minor-determinant formula; its multiplicativity is Cauchy–Binet).

Theorem A's isomorphism is the composite: $\wedge^n H_1(T^r) \to H_n(T^r)$ (Theorem C applied
to $G = T^r$) is an isomorphism because it sends the exterior basis to the coordinate-subtorus
basis of Theorem A's free module (§6). Theorem D is the coordinate description used by every
consumer that computes monodromy actions on $H_n$ of tori.

## 2. Conventions and standing inputs

Singular chains and homology with $\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients, the two-arc cover of the circle,
Mayer–Vietoris, and the homology of a point are lane A material and are cited by name. The
singular cross product $\times \colon H_p(X) \otimes H_q(Y) \to H_{p+q}(X \times Y)$ with its
Leibniz rule, naturality, unitality, swap law
$(\mathrm{swap})_*(a \times b) = (-1)^{pq}\, b \times a$ and associator coherence is lane C
material (`CrossProduct.lean`), cited by name. The circle $S^1$ is the additive circle
$\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$; $[S^1]$ is the class of the positively oriented fundamental cycle (the
sum of two arcs; the code's `arcSumCycle`). The product torus is $T^r := (S^1)^r$, a
topological abelian group under coordinatewise addition. Exterior powers $\wedge^n M$ are
Mathlib's (the quotient of $M^{\otimes n}$ by the alternating relations; universal alternating
map $\iota_n \colon M^n \to \wedge^n M$).

## 3. The circle splitting (proof of Theorem B)

Cover $S^1 = U \cup V$ by two open arcs with intersection two short arcs around the two
"poles", so $U, V \simeq *$, $U \cap V \simeq S^0$, all pulled back to the cover
$\{U \times Y, V \times Y\}$ of $S^1 \times Y$. Mayer–Vietoris for this cover gives
$$\dots \to H_{n+1}(U \times Y) \oplus H_{n+1}(V \times Y) \;\to\;
H_{n+1}(S^1 \times Y) \xrightarrow{\partial} H_n((U \cap V) \times Y) \to
H_n(U \times Y) \oplus H_n(V \times Y) \to \dots$$
and the identifications $H_k(U \times Y) \oplus H_k(V \times Y) \cong H_k(Y)^2$,
$H_k(U \cap V \times Y) \cong H_k(Y)^2$ turn the connecting homomorphism and the restriction
map into
$$\partial \colon H_{n+1}(S^1 \times Y) \to H_n(Y)^2, \qquad
\mathrm{res} \colon H_n(Y)^2 \to H_n(Y)^2,\ (u, v) \mapsto (u + v,\ u + v)$$
(the restrictions of a class on $U \times Y$ and $V \times Y$ to each intersection arc agree,
both being the pullback along the inclusion; Hatcher's MV convention puts a minus on the
$V$-summand, which conjugates the displayed map by the automorphism $(x, y) \mapsto (x, -y)$
of $H_n(Y)^2$ — kernel and cokernel below are unchanged). The kernel of $\mathrm{res}$ is
$\{(b, -b)\} \cong H_n(Y)$, and its image is the diagonal $\{(w, w)\}$, so
$\mathrm{coker}\, \mathrm{res} \cong H_n(Y)$ via $(x, y) \mapsto x - y$ (in every degree).
A long exact sequence $\dots \to A \to B \to C \to D \to E \to \dots$ always breaks into
$0 \to \mathrm{coker} \to C \to \ker \to 0$; here that gives
$$0 \longrightarrow \mathrm{coker}\, \mathrm{res}_{n+1} \cong H_{n+1}(Y)
\longrightarrow H_{n+1}(S^1 \times Y)
\longrightarrow \ker \mathrm{res}_n \cong H_n(Y) \longrightarrow 0,$$
the short exact sequence of Theorem B.

**The splitting.** The cross product with $[S^1]$ splits $\partial$: for $b \in H_n(Y)$,
$$\partial\big([S^1] \times b\big) = \big(\pm b, \mp b\big),$$
because the chain-level boundary of the product cycle $[\text{arc sum}] \times b$ is the
difference of the two endpoint contributions (the Leibniz rule kills $b$'s boundary term since
$\partial b = 0$; the boundary of the fundamental cycle of $S^1$ is the difference of the two
poles, and the two intersection arcs contribute with opposite orientation signs). With the sign
conventions of the cover fixed once, $\partial([S^1] \times b) = (b, -b)$ up to the chosen
isomorphism $\ker \mathrm{res} \cong H_n(Y)$; hence $b \mapsto [S^1] \times b$ is a right
inverse of $\partial$, and
$$H_{n+1}(S^1 \times Y) \cong H_{n+1}(Y) \oplus H_n(Y),$$
naturally in $Y$ (naturality of Mayer–Vietoris and of the cross product). This is the code's
`circleProductHomologyEquiv`; the section identification is `positiveCircleCross` with
`circleBoundary_positiveCircleCross`. $\square$

## 4. The homology of the product torus (proof of Theorem A, first half)

**Proposition.** $H_n(T^r)$ is free abelian of rank $\binom{r}{n}$ (zero for $n > r$).

*Proof.* Simultaneous structural recursion on $(r, n)$. $H_0(T^r) = \mathbb{Z}$ since $T^r$ is
path connected. $H_n(T^0) = H_n(\mathrm{pt}) = 0$ for $n \geq 1$. The step: $T^{r+1} = S^1
\times T^r$, so by Theorem B
$$H_n(T^{r+1}) \cong H_n(T^r) \oplus H_{n-1}(T^r)
\cong \mathbb{Z}^{\binom{r}{n}} \oplus \mathbb{Z}^{\binom{r}{n-1}}
= \mathbb{Z}^{\binom{r+1}{n}}$$
by Pascal's rule $\binom{r}{n} + \binom{r}{n-1} = \binom{r+1}{n}$. Freeness and finiteness are
preserved by the splitting; vanishing for $n > r$ follows from $\binom{r}{n} = 0$ in that
range. $\square$

**The coordinate basis.** For each $n$-element subset $s = \{i_1 < \dots < i_n\}$ of
$\{1, \dots, r\}$ let $\iota_s \colon T^n \to T^r$ be the coordinate subtorus (coordinates $s$),
and let $\tau_s := \iota_{s*}[T^n] \in H_n(T^r)$, the pushforward of the top class.

**Proposition (the basis theorem).** *The classes $\tau_s$ are the basis of the free module
$H_n(T^r)$ matching the binomial basis of §4 under the isomorphism constructed there.*

*Proof.* Induction on $r$ following the splitting of §3. $r = 0$ and $n = 0$ are immediate. In
the step $T^{r+1} = S^1 \times T^r$: the subsets of $\{1, \dots, r+1\}$ of size $n$ split into
those not containing $1$ (giving $\tau_s = \mathrm{incl}_{0*}(\tau^{(r)}_s)$, the pushforward
of the inductively known class along the slice inclusion
$\mathrm{incl}_0 \colon T^r \hookrightarrow S^1 \times T^r$ — the first-summand inclusion, a
section of $\mathrm{pr}_{2*}$) and those containing $1$ (giving
$\tau_{\{1\} \cup s'} = [S^1] \times \tau_{s'}$ — the cross product with the positive
generator, which is the second summand inclusion by §3's splitting). So the family
$(\tau_s)$ maps to the union of the two inductively known bases, which is a basis. $\square$

**The top class.** $[T^r] := \tau_{\{1,\dots,r\}} \in H_r(T^r) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ is the
fundamental class; it equals the iterated cross product $[S^1] \times \dots \times [S^1]$ ($r$
factors), by the same induction.

## 5. The Pontryagin product (proof of Theorem C)

Let $G$ be a topological abelian group with addition $\mu \colon G \times G \to G$.

**Definition.** $a \cdot b := \mu_*(a \times b)$ for $a \in H_p(G)$, $b \in H_q(G)$; bilinear,
so $H_*(G)$ becomes a $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra once the axioms are checked.

**Unit.** The class $1 := [\mathrm{pt}_0] \in H_0(G)$ of the identity point is a unit:
$\mu \circ (\mathrm{const}_0, \mathrm{id}) = \mathrm{id}$, and the cross product is unital
($[\mathrm{pt}] \times b = b$ under $G \times \{\mathrm{pt}\} = G$), so $1 \cdot b = b$; the
other side is symmetric.

**Associativity.** $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = \mu_*(\mu_*(a \times b) \times c)$; write the
right-hand side via functoriality as $(\mu \circ (\mu \times \mathrm{id}))_*$ of the threefold
cross product $(a \times b) \times c$. The two bracketings of the threefold cross product differ
by the associator homeomorphism of $X \times (Y \times Z) \cong (X \times Y) \times Z$, under
which the cross product is coherent *up to a canonical chain homotopy* (the associator
homotopy: the two shuffle triangulations of $\Delta^p \times \Delta^q \times \Delta^r$ are
related by an explicit prism family — lane C records this as the associator coherence of the
cross product), and $\mu \circ (\mu \times \mathrm{id}) = \mu \circ (\mathrm{id} \times \mu)$
exactly (associativity of the group). Hence $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$.

**Graded commutativity.** For the swap homeomorphism $s \colon G \times G \to G \times G$,
commutativity of $\mu$ gives $\mu \circ s = \mu$, so
$$b \cdot a = \mu_*(b \times a) = \mu_*\, s_* (b \times a)
= (-1)^{pq}\, \mu_*(a \times b) = (-1)^{pq}\, a \cdot b,$$
the third equality being the swap law of the cross product (lane C; proved by an explicit
chain homotopy between the swapped shuffle triangulation and the sign-twisted one).

**Strict alternation on $H_1$.** For $a \in H_1(G)$, graded commutativity gives
$a \cdot a = - a \cdot a$, so $2(a \cdot a) = 0$; if $H_2(G)$ has no $2$-torsion then
$a \cdot a = 0$. The $n$-fold product $a_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot a_n$ is therefore an alternating
multilinear map $H_1(G)^n \to H_n(G)$ — swapping adjacent factors introduces a sign, and a
repeated factor kills the product — so it descends to
$$\wedge^n H_1(G) \longrightarrow H_n(G), \qquad a_1 \wedge \dots \wedge a_n \mapsto
a_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot a_n,$$
for every $n$ (the formalization carries $n = 2, 3$ today; the general-$n$ descent is the same
two properties — adjacent-swap antisymmetry and diagonal vanishing — quantified over the
adjacent-transposition generating set of $S_n$, and is this lane's new mathematics at general
$n$; see ledger row J6).

## 6. The torus is an exterior algebra on $H_1$ (Theorem A, second half)

Apply §5 to $G = T^r$ (all homology free, so no torsion hypothesis is needed).
$H_1(T^r) \cong \mathbb{Z}^r$ with basis the coordinate loops $\ell_i$ ($i = 1, \dots, r$).

**Theorem (exterior form of Theorem A; Hatcher Example 3.16 and §3.C Exercise 11).** *The wedge map
$\wedge^n H_1(T^r) \to H_n(T^r)$ is an isomorphism for all $n$; explicitly,
$$\ell_{i_1} \wedge \dots \wedge \ell_{i_n} \longmapsto \pm\, \tau_{\{i_1, \dots, i_n\}},$$
the coordinate-subtorus top classes of §4 (the sign is the shuffle orientation of the chosen
ordering; with the conventions of §4 the sign is $+1$).*

*Proof.* The image claim is an induction on $r$ as in §4: the coordinate loop
$\ell_1 \in H_1(T^{r+1})$ is $[S^1]$ in the first factor, and the Pontryagin product of $[S^1]$
with a class of the $T^r$ factor is exactly the cross product $[S^1] \times \tau_{s'}$:
for the slice inclusions $\mathrm{incl}_1 \colon S^1 \to S^1 \times T^r$ and
$\mathrm{incl}_2 \colon T^r \to S^1 \times T^r$ one has
$\mu \circ (\mathrm{incl}_1 \times \mathrm{incl}_2) = \mathrm{id}$ on the nose, hence
$\mu_*(\mathrm{incl}_{1*} a \times \mathrm{incl}_{2*} b)
= (\mu \circ (\mathrm{incl}_1 \times \mathrm{incl}_2))_*(a \times b) = a \times b$.
So the basis of §4 is the set of iterated products of coordinate loops. Hence the wedge map hits a
basis: it is surjective. Both sides are free of rank $\binom{r}{n}$ (§4; Theorem D's basis
count), and a surjective linear map between finite free modules of the same rank is an
isomorphism (the Orzech property: a surjective endomorphism of a noetherian module is
bijective, applied after choosing bases). $\square$

## 7. Exterior coordinates (proof of Theorem D)

Let $M = \mathbb{Z}^m$ with standard basis. The $n$-subsets $s \subseteq \{1, \dots, m\}$ are
indexed increasingly, $s = \{i_1 < \dots < i_n\}$; set $e_s := e_{i_1} \wedge \dots \wedge
e_{i_n} \in \wedge^n M$.

**Lemma (standard basis).** *The family $(e_s)$, $s$ ranging over the
$\binom{m}{n}$ $n$-subsets, is a basis of $\wedge^n M$.* (The $n$-fold tensor power has basis
$e_{i_1} \otimes \dots \otimes e_{i_n}$; the exterior power is its quotient by the alternating
relations, and the increasing-index images survive as a basis — this is Mathlib's
`exteriorPower` basis machinery; the lane records the repackaging into the subset-indexed
basis.)

**Theorem (minor formula).** *For $A \in \mathrm{M}_m(\mathbb{Z})$ and $n$-subsets $s, t$,*
$$\big(\wedge^n A\big)_{s,t} \;=\; \det\big(A_{s,t}\big),$$
*where $A_{s,t}$ is the $n \times n$ submatrix on rows $s$, columns $t$.*

*Proof.* Expand
$$\wedge^n A (e_t) = \big(A e_{j_1}\big) \wedge \dots \wedge \big(A e_{j_n}\big)
= \Big(\sum_i A_{i j_1} e_i\Big) \wedge \dots \wedge \Big(\sum_i A_{i j_n} e_i\Big)
= \sum_{i_1, \dots, i_n} \Big(\prod_k A_{i_k j_k}\Big)\, e_{i_1} \wedge \dots \wedge e_{i_n}.$$
Terms with a repeated index vanish (alternation); the remaining terms are permutations
$\sigma$ of each $s$, and $e_{i_{\sigma(1)}} \wedge \dots \wedge e_{i_{\sigma(n)}} =
\mathrm{sign}(\sigma)\, e_s$; collecting gives
$\sum_s \big(\sum_\sigma \mathrm{sign}(\sigma) \prod_k A_{i_{\sigma(k)} j_k}\big) e_s
= \sum_s \det(A_{s,t})\, e_s$. $\square$

Functoriality $\wedge^n(AB) = \wedge^n A \circ \wedge^n B$ (Mathlib's) applied to the minor
formula is the Cauchy–Binet formula $\det((AB)_{s,t}) = \sum_u \det(A_{s,u}) \det(B_{u,t})$;
the library file records it as a corollary.

**Coordinate matrices.** For the consumers the $n = 2, 3$ coordinate matrices of $\wedge^n A$
get explicit names ($A^{\wedge 2}$, an $\binom{m}{2} \times \binom{m}{2}$ matrix; $A^{\wedge 3}$
likewise) with the subset order fixed lexicographically; the content of "the monodromy acts on
$H_2(T^r)$ by the matrix of $2 \times 2$ minors" is exactly Theorem D read in these bases.

## 8. What stays CHARGED

The concrete rank-4 objects of the project — the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^4$, the quotient torus
$\mathbb{R}^4 / \mathbb{Z}^4$, the named monodromy matrices and their exterior squares/cubes
evaluated `by decide` — are project data and stay in `Hopf/Proof/FiniteCore.lean` (and
`Hopf/Proof/LCP/LocalModels.lean`). They become thin instantiations: each `by decide` matrix identity
is the generic minor-formula (Theorem D) evaluated at a concrete matrix. The homeomorphism
bridges $\mathbb{R}^4/\mathbb{Z}^4 \cong (S^1)^4$ and their rank-3 cousins
(`splitFlatTorusHomeomorph` etc.) are likewise adapters: the general theorem is about the
*product* torus $(S^1)^r$, and quotient-torus statements transport across the homeomorphism.

# Axes 2–3 — additive decomposition, in dependency order

J8's basis/rank count (`standardExteriorBasis`, finrank of $\wedge^n \mathbb{Z}^m$) feeds
J7's Orzech step, so the true order is J2 → J1 → J3 → J4 → J5 → J6 → J8 → J7.

# Axis 5 — typed ledger

**Review-3 status (15bd5f7 + uncommitted reviewer repairs): J-A GO only —
superseded by integration-3** (J-A/J-B1/J-C1 have since landed in
`Lib/LinearAlgebra/ExteriorPower/MinorCoordinates.lean`,
`Lib/AlgebraicTopology/SingularHomology/Torus.lean`, and
`Lib/AlgebraicTopology/SingularHomology/Pontryagin.lean`; landed coordinates are
given per-declaration below).
J-A's 15-node interface, concrete representation construction and separate importing
consumer have been checked; its reviewed ledger hash and commands are in the
review-3 receipt. This is not a GO for the whole lane. J-B..J-D are explicitly gated
by proof closures and public-module seams below; J-E remains deferred. All newly
added or changed signature shapes were probed before recording, with provisional
inputs identified in the receipt. This status supersedes earlier claims below that
the second-pass repair was complete. Muse must review the uncommitted amendments;
any further change to the J-A packet invalidates its reviewed hash.

**Revision note (2026-09-12, second pass).** The first-pass ledger and its probes were
independently reviewed by seat `devin-axis5-j` → **NO-GO** (nine findings; the review
is committed in-tree as `Lib/docs/J-axis5-review.md`). This revision:

* fixes both proposed signatures to universe `Type` — `SingularMayerVietoris.SingularHomology`
  takes `Y : Type` (`MayerVietoris.lean:939`) and `crossProductHomology` takes
  `(X Y : Type)` (`CrossProduct.lean:1855`), so `Type*` does not elaborate;
* records the full namespace/elaboration context (below);
* enumerates every in-scope declaration with its exact current signature, source
  location, and disposition — public outputs get exact target signatures, internal
  movers get a name+line manifest (verbatim signatures, unchanged);
* re-orders J8 before J7 and splits each file's boundary into independently green
  sub-boundaries with named unlanded seams;
* narrows the general-`n` wedge (former G-J2 degree-`n` part) into deferred boundary
  J-E with its missing inputs enumerated — the general-degree swap/associativity the
  descent needs do not exist at head (the landed coherence laws are at degrees
  `(1,1)`/`(1,1,1)` only).

## Context and elaboration conventions

* All declarations below live inside `namespace Mathoverflow1973` — the standing Lib
  convention (`CrossProduct.lean:92`; the rename to `AlgebraicTopology.SingularHomology.*`
  is a separate scheduled commit). The ledger records **landing names** (current names
  verbatim); post-rename names are the same identifiers under
  `AlgebraicTopology.SingularHomology.<file-prefix>`.
* `⋀[ℤ]^n M` is pinned-Mathlib notation for `ExteriorAlgebra.exteriorPower ℤ n M`
  (`Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/ExteriorAlgebra/Basic.lean:83`); the bare identifier needs
  `open ExteriorAlgebra`. The root namespace `exteriorPower`
  (`Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/ExteriorPower/Basic.lean:47`) supplies `exteriorPower.ιMulti`
  (:56), `exteriorPower.alternatingMapLinearEquiv` (:212), `exteriorPower.map` (:260).
* `attribute [local instance] PeriodTorusHigherHomology.integerLinearMapModule
  PeriodTorusHigherHomology.integerTensorModule` must be reproduced at the source's
  cross-product/Pontryagin wrapper sites when comparing nested linear-map types — the two
  `@[instance_reducible]` definitions (`CrossProduct.lean:99`,`:108`) differ from the
  ambient `AddCommGroup.toIntModule`, and signatures written in the wrong instance
  context do not elaborate identically. The definitions themselves land in lane C's
  `CrossProduct.lean` (already present); the `attribute [local instance] … in`
  wrappers are reproduced per-site in the moved code.
* Universes: all spaces are `Type` (universe 0). No `Type*` generalization is promised
  at this boundary.
* `Lattice`/`LatticeMatrix`/`PeriodDomain` are CHARGED rank-4 abbreviations
  (`Hopf/Proof/FiniteCore.lean:277`,`:280`; `Hopf/Proof/LCP/LocalModels.lean:312`) — they are **not**
  Lib-importable. Every generalized target below replaces `Fin 4` by `Fin r`, or drops
  the lattice pin entirely (`c : M →ₗ[ℤ] SH G 1` for arbitrary `M`).
* `SH X n` in prose is `SingularMayerVietoris.SingularHomology X n`; signatures below
  spell the full name.
* Inside `namespace Mathoverflow1973`, use `open SingularHomology`,
  `open scoped Matrix BigOperators TensorProduct` and `noncomputable section`. The unqualified circle, point-class,
  homology-equivalence and composition APIs in the ledger resolve in `SingularHomology`,
  not via the exports in `Hopf/LibShims.lean`. Inside each declaration's dotted namespace,
  its own earlier landing names are in scope; cross-namespace references must be qualified.
  The circle-section signatures additionally need `open PeriodTorusHigherHomology`
  for the bare `CirclePaths.{positiveLoop, arcSumCycle}` and `circleProductMap` names.
  `circleProductMap` is a Lib provider (CircleProduct.lean:1241); the `CirclePaths.*`
  names are landed in `Lib/AlgebraicTopology/SingularHomology/CirclePaths.lean`
  (namespace `Mathoverflow1973.PeriodTorusHigherHomology.CirclePaths`), so
  `open PeriodTorusHigherHomology` resolves them in a Lib-only packet.
* The degree-one target API is `AlgebraicTopology.SingularH1`,
  `AlgebraicTopology.SingularH1.map` and `AlgebraicTopology.Hurewicz.loopHomologyClass`
  from `Lib.AlgebraicTopology.Hurewicz.Degree1` (106, 334, 726). The first two agree
  definitionally with `SingularMayerVietoris.SingularHomology X 1` and
  `SingularMayerVietoris.singularHomologyMap f 1` (review-3 module probe, `rfl`).
  `SingularChains.singularComplex` is the real chain API. No `Hopf.LibShims` import
  or compatibility alias is permitted in a production packet.
* **Module seam M-C (RESOLVED at integration-3):** `CrossProduct.lean` is now a
  `module` file (`module`/`public import`, lines 6–11) — the provider cone is
  converted and the J-C/J-B2 gating objection no longer applies. (At `15bd5f7`,
  `CrossProduct.lean:6–9` and `PathClass.lean:6–18` were legacy files; a `module`
  probe then rejected importing CrossProduct. The review-3 provisional probes
  reproduced the instance definitions in an isolated namespace — no longer needed
  for certification.)
* Replacing old loop-class aliases by the Degree1 API is **not** a claim that the old
  and new loop-class proof terms are definitionally equal. The unchanged old proof
  closures through legacy PathClass must be re-aligned to the public Degree1 API;
  this is a named J-B2 representation seam, not work silently delegated to Axis 6.

## Boundary J-A — `Lib/LinearAlgebra/ExteriorPower/MinorCoordinates.lean`

```

Probed 2026 (production `module`/`public` file, Mathlib-only imports): every
signature below elaborates; `exteriorPower_finrank_choose` and
`powersetCardFinEquiv_lt_iff` are already *proved* in the probe. Receipt:
`Lib/docs/J-INTERFACE_RECEIPT.md` §J-A.

Two corrections vs. the second-pass ledger (devin-axis5-j re-review findings 1–2):
the reindex direction is now `(…).reindex (powersetCardFinEquiv m n)` — `reindex`
takes `ι ≃ ι'` where the basis is indexed by `ι` — and the coordinate map uses
`.equivFun` (codomain `Fin _ → ℤ`), not `.repr` (codomain `Fin _ →₀ ℤ`).

### J-A ChallengeNode manifest

For each row, `id = J-A.<output>`, `class = FREE`, `signature` is the exact named
Lean declaration below, and `destination` is that public name in the namespace/file
above. `imports`, `visibility`, `commit_boundary`, `focused_check` and `return_seam`
are inherited from the J-A block. The source text is §7 of this file, whose hash is
covered by the complete ledger SHA-256 in the review-3 receipt. `representation` is
the concrete construction/equation below, independently elaborated in J3A.lean;
rows marked theorem shell require only the substantive proof, not a redesigned type.
All 15 names were checked by a separate importing consumer. Order is table order.

J-A has no dependency on J-B..J-E, Hopf, or the legacy CrossProduct provider.
The rank-four compatibility adapters remain separate charged consumers; their old
signatures and coordinates are preserved until the order-theoretic replacement is proved.

### The enumeration (reviewer finding 1)

`Set.powersetCard (Fin m) n` already carries the *subset* `PartialOrder`, so a
lex order cannot be added as an instance on it directly; the lex order lives on
a `Lex` synonym (`Lex α` carries no order passthrough instance):

```lean
public abbrev SortedSubset (m n : ℕ) := Lex (Set.powersetCard (Fin m) n)

public instance sortedSubsetFintype (m n : ℕ) : Fintype (SortedSubset m n) -- inferInstanceAs
public instance sortedSubsetLinearOrder (m n : ℕ) : LinearOrder (SortedSubset m n)
  -- LinearOrder.lift' (fun s ↦ (ofLex s).1.sort (· ≤ ·)) inj
  -- inj: apply ofLex.injective; apply Subtype.ext;
  -- simpa using congrArg List.toFinset h (simp uses Finset.sort_toFinset).

public theorem sortedSubset_card (m n : ℕ) :
    Fintype.card (SortedSubset m n) = m.choose n
  -- first Fintype.card_congr toLex.symm removes the Lex synonym;
  -- then Set.powersetCard.card + Nat.card_eq_fintype_card + Fintype.card_fin.

/-- The lexicographic enumeration of `n`-subsets of `Fin m`. -/
public def powersetCardFinEquiv (m n : ℕ) :
    Set.powersetCard (Fin m) n ≃ Fin (m.choose n)
  -- body (PROBED): toLex.trans ((Equiv.subtypeUnivEquiv mem_univ).symm.trans
  --   ((Finset.orderIsoOfFin univ sortedSubset_card).symm.toEquiv))

/-- The enumeration is pinned by its characterization — `e` is the order-iso
for lex-on-sorted-tuples: -/
public theorem powersetCardFinEquiv_lt_iff {m n : ℕ}
    (s t : Set.powersetCard (Fin m) n) :
    powersetCardFinEquiv m n s < powersetCardFinEquiv m n t ↔
      List.Lex (· < ·) ((s : Finset (Fin m)).sort (· ≤ ·))
        ((t : Finset (Fin m)).sort (· ≤ ·))
```

**Rank-4 compatibility** (reviewer demand — the enumeration must agree with
`pairSubsetEquiv`/`tripleSubsetEquiv`, which stay Hopf-side as charged adapters):
the compatibility equation

```lean
∀ i : Fin 6, powersetCardFinEquiv 4 2
  (PeriodTorusHigherHomologyExterior.pairSubset i) = i
```

is *not* stated in `MinorCoordinates.lean` (it references the charged
`pairSubset`).  It is proved in the Hopf adapter from
`powersetCardFinEquiv_lt_iff` + `pairSubset_ordered` (the sorted tuple of
`pairSubset i` is `pairIndices i`, and `pairIndices` enumerates in lex order —
a `decide`-able check on `Fin 6` literal vectors) + the fact that a strictly
monotone map `Fin k → Fin k` is the identity (`StrictMono` on `Fin` is
uniqueness-forced).  Note: `powersetCardFinEquiv` itself does **not** reduce
under kernel `decide` (probed — `orderIsoOfFin`'s inverse threads through
`List.Sorted.getIso`/`Equiv` machinery that stalls evaluation), so the compat
route is order-theoretic, not computational.

### Basis, coordinates, rank

```lean
-- verbatim move (Specialization:6637 → MinorCoordinates.lean:91):
public noncomputable def standardExteriorBasis (m n : ℕ) :
    Module.Basis (Set.powersetCard (Fin m) n) ℤ (⋀[ℤ]^n (Fin m → ℤ))
  -- body: (Pi.basisFun ℤ (Fin m)).exteriorPower n   (Mathlib

-- NEW — generalized `squareBasis`/`cubeBasis` (Specialization:6742/6745 — now generalized at MinorCoordinates.lean:119).  Direction matches

-- `pairSubsetEquiv.symm : powersetCard → Fin 6`; here the equiv already runs
-- `powersetCard → Fin (m.choose n)`, so no `.symm`:
public noncomputable def standardExteriorBasisFin (m n : ℕ) :
    Module.Basis (Fin (m.choose n)) ℤ (⋀[ℤ]^n (Fin m → ℤ))
  -- body: (standardExteriorBasis m n).reindex (powersetCardFinEquiv m n)

    (⋀[ℤ]^n (Fin m → ℤ)) ≃ₗ[ℤ] (Fin (m.choose n) → ℤ)
  -- body: (standardExteriorBasisFin m n).equivFun

-- NEW — the rank count J7's Orzech step consumes; direct corollary of Mathlib's
-- `exteriorPower.finrank_eq` (already in pinned Mathlib — not new math):
public theorem exteriorPower_finrank_choose (m n : ℕ) :

  -- body (PROBED): rw [exteriorPower.finrank_eq,
  --   Module.finrank_fintype_fun_eq_card, Fintype.card_fin]
```

### Minor matrix, induced map, Cauchy–Binet

`exteriorMinorMatrix` is made *rectangular* (row-set ⊆ `Fin p`, column-set ⊆
`Fin m`) rather than square-only — the source `exteriorSquare`/`exteriorCube`
are the `p = m = 4` specializations, and Cauchy–Binet is genuinely rectangular:

```lean
/-- Entry (s,t) = the n×n minor of T on row-set s, column-set t. -/
public def exteriorMinorMatrix (p m n : ℕ) (T : Matrix (Fin p) (Fin m) ℤ) :
    Matrix (Fin (p.choose n)) (Fin (m.choose n)) ℤ
  -- body (PROBED): fun s t ↦ (T.submatrix
  --   ((Set.powersetCard.ofFinEmbEquiv.symm
  --       ((powersetCardFinEquiv p n).symm s) : Fin n → Fin p))
  --   ((Set.powersetCard.ofFinEmbEquiv.symm
  --       ((powersetCardFinEquiv m n).symm t) : Fin n → Fin m))).det

-- generalized `exteriorMap` (6826, now Proof/LCP/Specialization.lean:3890), rectangular:
public noncomputable def exteriorPowerMap (p m n : ℕ)
    (A : Matrix (Fin p) (Fin m) ℤ) :
    (⋀[ℤ]^n (Fin m → ℤ)) →ₗ[ℤ] (⋀[ℤ]^n (Fin p → ℤ))
  -- body: exteriorPower.map n A.mulVecLin

-- generalized `squareMap_toMatrix`/`cubeMap_toMatrix` (6854/6861):
public theorem exteriorPowerMap_toMatrix (p m n : ℕ)
    (A : Matrix (Fin p) (Fin m) ℤ) :
    LinearMap.toMatrix (standardExteriorBasisFin m n)
        (standardExteriorBasisFin p n) (exteriorPowerMap p m n A) =
      exteriorMinorMatrix p m n A
  -- recipe: `LinearMap.toMatrix_apply` + `exteriorPower.basis_apply` +
  --   `exteriorPower.map_comp_ιMulti_family` + `exteriorPower.basis_repr_apply` +
  --   `exteriorPower.ιMultiDual_apply_ιMulti` gives det of the coord submatrix
  --   = minor of `toMatrix (Pi.basisFun) (Pi.basisFun) A.mulVecLin` (= `A`,
  --   since `A.mulVecLin` is `Matrix.toLin' A` up to basis identification and
  --   `LinearMap.toMatrix'_toLin'`/`Pi.basisFun` lemmas apply); `Matrix.det`
  --   transpose-invariance kills the transpose in the submatrix orientation.

-- NEW — the Cauchy–Binet corollary promised by §7 (matrix form; the
-- powersetCard-sum entrywise form follows by `Matrix.mul_apply` + reindexing
-- the sum by `powersetCardFinEquiv`):
public theorem cauchyBinet_minors (p q m n : ℕ)
    (A : Matrix (Fin p) (Fin q) ℤ) (B : Matrix (Fin q) (Fin m) ℤ) :
    exteriorMinorMatrix p m n (A * B) =
      exteriorMinorMatrix p q n A * exteriorMinorMatrix q m n B
  -- recipe: `exteriorPowerMap_toMatrix` thrice + `Matrix.mulVecLin_mul`
  --   (ToLin.lean:334) + `exteriorPower.map_comp` + `toMatrix` of `comp`
  --   equals product.
```

Rank-4 compatibility declarations (Specialization 6662–6882 at 15bd5f7, now
`PeriodTorusHigherHomologyExterior` in Proof/LCP/Specialization.lean:3726+) are **retained in Hopf**
until their replacements and coordinate-compatibility equations are proved and their
consumers rerouted. They are not public outputs of the Mathlib-only J-A packet.
In particular pairSubset/tripleSubset, their ordered/equivalence lemmas and the old
coordinate maps must not be deleted before the order-theoretic adapters exist.
The following is the migration inventory, not an instruction to delete at J-A landing:
`latticeExterior` (6662), `latticeBasis` (6665), `latticeExteriorBasis` (6668),
`pairIndices_strictMono` (6672), `tripleIndices_strictMono` (6675), `pairIndices_injective`
(6678), `tripleIndices_injective` (6681), `pairEmbedding` (6684), `tripleEmbedding` (6687),
`pairSubset` (6690), `tripleSubset` (6693), `pairSubset_ordered` (6697),
`tripleSubset_ordered` (6704), `pairSubset_injective` (6710), `tripleSubset_injective`
(6716), `pairSubset_bijective` (6723), `tripleSubset_bijective` (6729), `pairSubsetEquiv`
(6736), `tripleSubsetEquiv` (6739), `squareBasis` (6742), `cubeBasis` (6745),
`squareBasis_apply` (6748), `cubeBasis_apply` (6756), `squareCoordinates` (6764),
`cubeCoordinates` (6767), `squareCoordinates_apply` (6771), `cubeCoordinates_apply` (6776),
`latticeExterior_finrank` (6780), `exteriorMap` (6826, → `exteriorPowerMap`),
`squareMap_coefficient` (6830, → `standardExterior_map_coefficient` +
`powersetCardFinEquiv` via the compat equation), `cubeMap_coefficient` (6843),
`squareMap_toMatrix` (6854), `cubeMap_toMatrix` (6861), `squareCoordinates_map` (6868),
`cubeCoordinates_map` (6876).

Compat detail: `pairSubsetEquiv : Fin 6 ≃ Set.powersetCard (Fin 4) 2` runs the
*opposite* direction to `powersetCardFinEquiv`; the adapter proves
`powersetCardFinEquiv 4 2 ∘ pairSubsetEquiv = id` (equivalently
`squareBasis = standardExteriorBasisFin 4 2`) from
`powersetCardFinEquiv_lt_iff` as described above — same for
`tripleSubsetEquiv` at `n = 3`.

Owner-flagged (not moved by J without owner sign-off): `LocalSystemMatrices.{pairIndices,
exteriorSquare, tripleIndices, exteriorCube}` (`Proof/FiniteCore.lean:390–399`) — generic
minor-matrix API at rank 4; recommend moving into `MinorCoordinates.lean` as the
lexicographic instances of `exteriorPowerMap_toMatrix`, or replacing by
`exteriorMinorMatrix 4 4 n` outright.

**J-B2a coordinate outputs — landed in LCP/Specialization.lean (interface side),
not part of J-B1.** Their proof closure needed S-nat, which has since landed
(`circleProductMap` at CircleProduct.lean:1241,
`circleProductHomologyEquiv_naturality` at :1396). In particular:
`coordinateTorusBasis_apply` (Specialization 6498, now LCP/Specialization.lean:642) →
`productTorusHomologyEquiv_coordinateTorusClass` (6459, now :603) →
`circleCoordinates_coordinateTorusClass_take` (6428, now :572) → S-nat.
The Along basis/span/range family inherits this dependency. Coordinate maps and
matrix helpers are grouped here conservatively rather than claimed as separate green units.

This gated the coordinate basis **and** the circle-section naturality result; the
gate is now open.

**S-path — circle-path closure, LANDED in
`Lib/AlgebraicTopology/SingularHomology/CirclePaths.lean`** (88 declarations,
extracted from `LCP/CuspFilling.lean:325–678` and
`Proof/LCP/CuspFilling.lean:13175–13857` at the pre-move head; signatures
verified verbatim modulo the retargets below). Includes CirclePaths.circleTranslation

(:688), threeQuarterIntersectionSection_component (:698), and
threeQuarterIntersectionSection_comp (:714), plus the two-chain engine
(`twoChainMiddle` :268, `twoChainSmallCycle` :336,
`connectingHomomorphism_twoChain` :401, the `biprod_*_mo1973_*` helpers
:188–266 — widened from `private` to public because `@[expose]`-exported
`def` bodies may not reference private declarations), the intersection
difference/cross-chain machinery (`intersectionDifferenceCycle` :770,
`uCrossChain`/`vCrossChain` :859/:868 and boundary/inclusion lemmas,
`positiveCircleSmallCycle*` :964–1015), and the section-coordinate
families (`*_toU`/`*_toV` :826–857, `*Homology_coordinates` :750/:760).

*Retargets applied on landing* (all public Lib APIs — no `Hopf.LibShims`):
`FirstHurewicz.*` → `SingularChains.*` (`Chains`, `singularComplex`,
`inducedChain*`, `pathChain*`, `boundaryOne*`, `Cycles1`, `mkCycle1`,
`cycleClass`, `chainClass`, `pathClass*`, `homologyToChainClass_*`,
`loopHomologyClass`, `inducedHomology`, `singularChainMap`);
`PeriodTorusHigherHomology.CircleTopology.*` → `SingularHomology.CircleTopology.*`;
bare `crossProduct*`/`crossInsertLeft`/`circle*`/`sumHomologyEquiv_*` names →
`SingularHomology.*` via `open SingularHomology`. NB on loop-class spelling:
the landed decls use `SingularChains.loopHomologyClass` — the constant the
source actually referenced through the `FirstHurewicz` export.
`AlgebraicTopology.Hurewicz.loopHomologyClass` (Degree1.lean) is a separate,
definitionally equal declaration; it is *not* the same constant, so
statement-level rewrites do not cross between the two spellings. The public
degree-one alignment for J-B2b is therefore a spelling choice, not a blocker.

**S-cross — cross-product naturality, LANDED in `CrossProduct.lean`:**
`crossProductCycles_natural` (:4292), `crossProductHomology_natural` (:4309),
`crossProductHomology_snd` (:4332) — was CuspFilling:14509–14576.

S-path named interfaces (landed, `CirclePaths.lean` coordinates) and landed S-cross
providers: `CirclePaths.{positiveLoop` (:129) + `positiveLoop_apply` (:138),
`quarterLoop` (:563), `arcSumCycle` (:632), `arcSumCycle_class`
(:637), `arcSumCycle_positiveLoop_class` (:651), `quarterIntersection` (:433),

(:656, `X : Type*`), `threeQuarterIntersectionSection` (:664, `X : Type*`),

`crossProductHomology_natural` (landed: CrossProduct.lean:4309),
`crossProductHomology_snd` (landed: CrossProduct.lean:4332).

Lane A's report (`Lib/reports/A.md` §Wang note) proposed that cluster for
`CrossProduct.lean`; the S-nat closure and the S-cross naturality suite have
**landed** (CircleProduct.lean:1241–1414 and CrossProduct.lean:4292–4332), and the
M-C module seam is resolved (CrossProduct.lean is `module`), and the **S-path**
cluster above has landed in `Lib/AlgebraicTopology/SingularHomology/CirclePaths.lean`
(Muse-seat extraction per `NEXT-STEPS-MUSE.md` §6 — the "not J-owned" note is
discharged by that assignment, not by J acquiring another lane). The module
compiles standalone (`lake build Lib.AlgebraicTopology.SingularHomology.CirclePaths`),
the `Lib` aggregate includes it, and all six direct consumers
(`Hopf/Proof/LCP/{CuspFilling, Specialization, BoundaryTopology, IntegralHomology}`,
`Hopf/LCP/{Specialization, IntegralHomology}`) build green against it. Only the
restricted J-B1 recursive core above is independent of this cluster.
NB: the `quarterIntersectionSection` family uses
`Type*` for the ambient space — harmless there (pure topology, no homology), kept as-is.

`crossProductHomology`,
`integerBilinearPostcompose`, `singularHomologyMap`, and the topology/linear algebra
APIs used in the source proofs; no torus import is needed by this sub-boundary.

Review-3 check: the degree transports below are explicit linear maps, and the two
coherence statements elaborate in a module with signature-only prerequisite inputs.
`homologyDegreeCast` and its reflexive identity were checked with actual terms.
This is type alignment only; no general cross product or coherence proof was constructed.

The §5–§6 statements at general `n` —
`Pontryagin.exteriorMap (G : Type) [TopologicalSpace G] [AddCommGroup G]
[IsTopologicalAddGroup G] [Module.IsTorsionFree ℤ (SH G 2)] (n : ℕ) :

`productTorusExteriorEquiv (r n : ℕ) : (⋀[ℤ]^n (SH (ProductTorus r) 1)) ≃ₗ[ℤ]
SH (ProductTorus r) n` —
need an `n`-fold iterated product and its alternating descent. The landed inputs are
insufficient: `crossProductHomology_swap` exists only at `(1,1)` (now CrossProduct.lean:2480)
and `crossProductHomology_associative` only at `(1,1,1)` (now CrossProduct.lean:4219).

J-E is returned to the Axis-3/decomposition seam: it waits on the same general-`(p,q)`
cross-product follow-up that already defers the general Pontryagin product. Owner
confirmation: whether the `n`-fold descent is J's once the coherence inputs land, or
folds into GLM's cross-product boundary.

## GLM exclusion manifest (G-J3)

Review-3 census was generated from `git show 15bd5f7:Hopf/LCP/Specialization.lean`:
number source lines, restrict to 3771–5987 inclusive, match declaration starts with
`^(?:noncomputable )?(?:theorem|def|lemma|instance|abbrev) (PeriodTorusHigherHomology\.[^\s({:]+)`.
This yields **110** excluded declarations (not Pontryagin-namespace declarations
interleaved in the same range). Expanding the suffix groups below reproduces this
name/line census. `chainTrilinearMap_ext` is included; all line numbers are declaration
starts rather than attribute lines. The exact script command is in the review-3 receipt.

J claims **no** declaration in `Hopf/LCP/Specialization.lean` lines 3771–5987
(at `15bd5f7`) belonging to the cross-product coherence suite. Exact excluded names

`Hopf/Proof/FiniteCore.lean` (`squareA₁` :402, `cubeM₀_eq` :453, and the `by decide`
instantiations — was :339–392) stays; after J-A lands, its proofs become one-line instantiations of
`standardExterior_map_coefficient`. The rank-4 `PeriodDomain`/`RealTorus₄`/`flatTorus*`
adapters (`realTorusHomologyEquiv` 6504 → Proof/LCP/Specialization.lean:3650,
`periodTorusHomologyEquiv` 6508 → :3654,

`periodTorusCircle_inducedHomology_periodLoop` 3446 → :3226, `coordinateH1_four_*`
6912–6929 → :3949–3966) stay in `Hopf/` as thin adapters — they consume the generalized J-B/J-D API
at `r = 4`.

# Open items, seams, probes

1. **Seams — all landed.** (First-pass probe ran at `f034c13`; coordinates re-verified
   at integration-3.) Lane A's API is in
   `Lib/AlgebraicTopology/SingularHomology/`: the abbrev
   `SingularMayerVietoris.SingularHomology` (`MayerVietoris.lean:939`),
   `SingularMayerVietoris.singularHomologyMap` (`MayerVietoris.lean:943`),
   the $S^1 \times Y$ splitting `SingularHomology.circleProductHomologyEquiv`
   (`CircleProduct.lean:891`, formerly SphereTopology 2191) with
   `circleSectionHomology`/`circleProjectionHomology`/`circleBoundaryCoordinates`, and
   `SingularHomology.{connectedHomologyZeroEquiv, totallyDisconnected_homology_subsingleton,
   homeomorphHomologyEquiv}` (`HomotopyInvariance.lean:247, 259, 179`). Lane C: the cross
   product `SingularHomology.crossProductHomology` at `(1, n)`
   (`CrossProduct.lean:1855`) plus boundary laws; the swap/associator coherence suite
   has landed in `CrossProduct.lean:2065–4359`. **Resolved seam** (the axis-5 review
   flagged it unlanded): `crossProductHomology_natural`
   (`CrossProduct.lean:4309`, together with `crossProductCycles_natural` :4292
   and `crossProductHomology_snd` :4332) is now a public Lib provider. Probe
   commands (first-pass receipt, runnable at head `f034c13`):
   `lake env lean Lib/AlgebraicTopology/SingularHomology/J_InterfaceCheck.lean`,
   likewise the consumer probe; receipt at `Lib/docs/J-INTERFACE_RECEIPT.md`. A
   aggregate probe against the final revised ledger — in the production `module`/`public`
   context and in destination namespaces, with a separate consumer — is required
   **before GO and before implementation**, not as landing work. Review-3 checks and
   limitations are recorded separately in the receipt.
2. **Pontryagin product shape — settled 2026-09-12.** The lane states `product` at `(1, n)`
   matching the landed cross product; general `(p, q)` is a named follow-up once C's general
   cross product lands (boundary J-C / deferred J-E).
3. **Q4 note** (minor formula exists outside the tree): moved as-is; de-duplication is the
   owner's call.
4. **`PeriodTorusHigherHomology.rightTranslation`** is defined in
   `Hopf/LCP/BoundaryTopology.lean:173` (was :14298 before the proof split), far from the torus API: at landing, check
   whether it belongs to `Torus.lean`; recorded here because it sits outside the lane's
   named ranges.
5. **Duplications to delete at landing**: `formalMap_comp` = `formalMap_comp_apply`
   (Specialization:3771 vs 4451 — now both in `Lib/AlgebraicTopology/SingularHomology/CrossProduct.lean`, identical statements);
   `productTorusHomologyEquiv_succ_pair` (LCP/Specialization.lean:583, was
   Specialization:6439) is an exact alias of the landed
   `productTorusHomologyEquiv_succ_apply` (Torus.lean:208).
6. **Bib keys.** `hatcher02` exists in the pinned Mathlib bib. Hirsch/Milnor keys are not needed
   for this lane.
7. **Citation flag for the owner.** The task file names this lane "Hatcher Ex. 2.48,
   Cor. 3.28, §3.C". Corollary 3.28 of Hatcher is the manifold-torsion corollary (torsion in
   $H_{n-1}$ of a closed $n$-manifold), not the torus computation; the correct references for
   this lane's content are Example 3.16 (the exterior-algebra ring computation) and §3.C
   Exercise 11 ($H_*(T^n;\mathbb{Z}) \cong \Lambda_\mathbb{Z}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$, $|x_i| = 1$),
   plus §3.B for the Künneth ranks and Ex. 2.48 for the Wang sequence. This document uses the
   corrected citations; no content change.
8. **Review.** Two independent reviews now exist for this lane. (a) Stage-2 review of
   §§1–8: done; the report (six corrections, four remarks, all incorporated in the
   current text) is committed in-tree as `Lib/docs/J-stage2-review.md` (Kimi seat,
   reviewer named there). (b) Axis-5 review of the first-pass ledger + probes by seat
   `devin-axis5-j` (GPT-6 Astra): **NO-GO**, nine findings — universe-0 vs `Type*` in the
   two proposed signatures, missing namespace/elaboration context and ChallengeNode
   fields, a genuine typed gap behind the general-`n` wedge descent, literal `…`s in
   signatures, stale ownership wording ("J appends G-J3"), the J7/J8 dependency order,
   and off-by-one source coordinates. All findings verified against the sources and
   incorporated into the present second-pass ledger (revision note at the top of the
   Axis-5 section). The review is committed in-tree as `Lib/docs/J-axis5-review.md`.
   Subsequent re-reviews (committed as `Lib/docs/J-axis5-review2.md` and
   `J-axis5-review3.md`) repaired the ledger further and returned a scoped J-A GO.
   At integration-3 (base `27f8e7f`, this branch) a fresh Axis-5 pass found the
   ledger's coordinates and seam claims stale after the `Hopf/` proof split and the
   S-nat/S-cross/G-J3 landings; two repair rounds and a targeted re-confirmation
   (**GO**) brought the ledger consistent at `88e354b` — recorded in
   `Lib/docs/J-axis5-i3-review.md`. Since then the S-path cluster has landed
   (`Lib/AlgebraicTopology/SingularHomology/CirclePaths.lean`, Muse-seat §6
   extraction; the "gate" paragraphs and coordinates above are updated to the
   landed coordinates). This is ledger consistency only: no
   J-B/J-C/J-D/J-E boundary is certified; J-B2a no longer waits on an external
   provider — its remaining work is the coordinate-basis closure itself.
   A re-review of this revised ledger is outstanding before J's
   Axis-6 work starts.
