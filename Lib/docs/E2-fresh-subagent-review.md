# E2 fresh independent review — CURRENT repaired revision

*Editorial note (Muse seat): absolute host paths in this report were rewritten to repo-relative or `~/` form when the file was brought in-tree; no other content changed.*

Additional current-source reads and a new changed-signature probe are recorded below.

### Scoped verdicts

1. **Stage-2 substantive mathematical repairs: GO.** Countability, compact-buffer reduction, rank-defect versus collision bounds, supported chart transport, tubular ambient disc shrinking/unshrinking, sphere approximation, and the dimension-two arc construction are now mathematically coherent. The conservative G-E2 interface `2k+1≤n` is valid; its unimplemented helper certification is not false mathematics.
2. **Unqualified freeze of the entire current mathematical/ledger document: NO-GO pending the small corrections below.** In particular, its claim that all SW coordinates are current is objectively false at this HEAD; a remaining padding parenthetical gives the wrong coproduct rank bound. These are targeted corrections, not a rejection of the repaired theorems or a request to redesign their proofs. The arc proof also needs its live dependency route recorded accurately for extraction.
3. **Changed headline signatures: GO in the tested legacy context.** The restored seven structure fields and complete finite-intersection signature match the actual source and elaborate, including structure conversions both ways and application of the existing finite-intersection theorem.
4. **Full certified Axis 5 / Axis 6: NO-GO, explicitly DRAFT.** E2 itself correctly says this at lines 3–8,399–404,545–570,917–944. Exact helper/import/output packets, module-ready providers, reviewed hash and aggregate producer/consumer receipts remain open. None of those open certification tasks alone invalidates Stage-2 mathematics.

## Numbered findings remaining in the CURRENT file

### 1. Live source provenance is still wrong, despite the repaired status banner

**E2.md:9,89,286,319,325,356,392–393,420,478,492–510,549–555,585–586,694–696,774–789,823–825,896.** Lines 549–555 say that the declarations live in SurgeryWindows/SH and that “all coordinates below are current.” At this HEAD `Lib/Geometry/Manifold/Morse/SurgeryWindows.lean` has **1838 lines**, so coordinates SW 7808, 10289, 11970, etc. cannot identify its live declarations. The statement at line 9 that repaired references were checked at `8e4a851` is historical provenance, not a remedy for asserting they are current here.

Current homes directly inspected:

| Output | Live source |
|---|---|
| manifold Sard | `Lib/Geometry/Manifold/Transversality/Basic.lean:227–251` |
| supported isotopy structure | `Lib/Geometry/Manifold/Morse/Cancellation.lean:3441–3450` |
| chart extension | `Lib/Geometry/Manifold/Transversality/Basic.lean:2547–2591` |
| chart disk shrinking | `Lib/Geometry/Manifold/Transversality/Basic.lean:2593–2645` |
| germ alignment | `Lib/Geometry/Manifold/Transversality/Basic.lean:2129–2238` |
| disk-chart assembly | `Lib/Geometry/Manifold/Transversality/Basic.lean:2672–2706` |
| same-center disc theorem | `Lib/Geometry/Manifold/Transversality/Basic.lean:2708–2751` |
| plane rank/collision engines | `Lib/Geometry/Manifold/Immersion/Relative.lean:1162–1228` |
| compact relative immersion | `Lib/Geometry/Manifold/Immersion/Relative.lean:1632–1665` |
| embedding from immersion | `Lib/Geometry/Manifold/Immersion/Relative.lean:2014–2030` |
| compact-buffer wrapper | `Lib/Geometry/Manifold/Immersion/Relative.lean:2032–2071` |
| finite-avoiding smooth paths | `Lib/Geometry/Manifold/Immersion/Relative.lean:340–380` |
| finite-fixing point motion | `Lib/Geometry/Manifold/Immersion/Relative.lean:382–390` |

**Concrete fix:** replace the live-source columns/comments with these current files and coordinates, or explicitly retain the SW numbers as historical coordinates and give a live mapping. Update the extraction/import graph accordingly: several proposed destination paths already contain substantial legacy implementations. Do not use old line ranges as deletion instructions. This is a ledger/provenance defect, not missing mathematics.

### 2. Padding corollary still states the wrong rank bound

**E2.md:223–229**, especially 228: “the image lands in a dim X-dimensional direction set.” The image of the **coproduct** derivative includes both the padded f derivative and dg. Its dimension is at most **dim X + dim Y**, not dim X. For example, a point source and an immersed curve have coproduct image dimension one, not zero.

**Concrete fix:** say: “the padded f derivative has image dimension at most dim X; together with dg the coproduct image has dimension at most dim X + dim Y < dim N.” The conclusion and choice of sphere padding are correct, and compact Y is now correctly supplied at lines 63–65. This is a local explanatory correction; no changed theorem, new helper architecture or counterexample to the corollary is involved.

### 3. Arc finite-avoidance paragraph is valid mathematics but not the recorded live proof route

**E2.md:472–478,510.** The document now correctly avoids invoking the n≥3 global curve-immersion theorem for an n≥2 result. Its punctured-ball detour argument is mathematically available, but the live helper does **not** implement that detour-and-smoothing proof. `Immersion/Relative.lean:340–380` models the finite forbidden set as a zero-manifold, takes a smooth connecting curve, then invokes **E5 map general position** on the interval with endpoints fixed, using `1+0<n`. Lines 382–390 invoke homogeneity in the complement.

**Concrete fix:** record E5 as the finite-avoidance input and recover that actual proof in §12a, or label the detour paragraph an alternative contextual argument rather than the extracted implementation. If retaining the detour proof, specify replacing the subpath between the first entry and last exit of a sufficiently small ball around each forbidden point; infinitely many visits do not justify an unexplained finite replacement count.

There is also a tiny endpoint explanation to add at **481–482**: if the forced old hit is x (which may belong to S), g avoids x in the open interval by injectivity and g(0)=x, not by the initial avoidance of S\{x}. The source makes this explicit at `Hopf/SingularHomology.lean:18502–18505`. The theorem and current signature allowing endpoints in S are correct.

### 4. Minor germ-estimate wording; distinguish context from exact proof-term route

**E2.md:299–303.** For a transition germ h with derivative identity, the small estimate is `d(h-id)=o(1)`, not `dh=o(1)`. The text says “its displacement is o(r) and its derivative is o(1)”; read literally as the germ's derivative, that is wrong, though the next sentence clearly uses the displacement derivative.

**Concrete fix:** write “the displacement h-id is o(r), and its derivative is o(1).” The cutoff derivative O(1/r) then gives the required small global derivative. This does not reopen the corrected germ argument.

The source's normal correction actually chooses a normal automorphism making the determinant exactly 1 (`Transversality/Basic.lean:2154–2172`), whereas the text first makes the sign positive and then allows positive scaling. These are compatible mathematical routes; the future exact helper packet should preserve the live determinant-one inputs instead of inferring an unrecorded flow API from the prose.

### 5. Full Axis-5 work is correctly deferred, not a hidden mathematical defect

**E2.md:399–404,541–570,903–935.** The repaired document now honestly separates new generalization from moves, model-source outputs from arbitrary-manifold context, draft boundary groups from per-file packets, and public module imports from legacy Hopf imports. This resolves the previous impossible transitional import instruction and overclaim of completed certification.

**Concrete next action:** keep the DRAFT status; complete minimal imports, exact helper signatures, source/consumer equations and independently green boundaries, then perform aggregate production providers and separate importing consumers with a receipt for the reviewed hash. The first-pass receipt is correctly treated as historical. General rank-stratum/collision estimates are meaningful open interfaces; no inference from “not yet certified” to “false” is warranted.

## Verified repairs against actual live proof bodies

### Countability and general-position scope — accepted

E2:32–38 now explicitly gives Hausdorff second-countable manifold conventions and preserves weaker per-theorem Lean hypotheses. Countable chart covers and compact exhaustion are now justified. The Sard proof at 152–163 is valid under these conventions; `Transversality/Basic.lean:227–246` explicitly uses Lindelöf and countable null union. The formal headline only returns a null exceptional set, not a separate comeager output. E2:63–65 now imposes compact Y for ambient padding, while the closed-range map form remains distinct.

Translation signs, plateau restriction, C1-small finite patch induction, and map avoidance remain sound. “Co-null sets are symmetric under negation” at 182 should be understood as invariance of conullness, not equality of each set with its negative.

### Relative immersion, compact buffer and dimension estimates — accepted

E2:344–356 gives Disjoint L C and a compact D inside the immersive open locus with T∩C contained in interior D. Then T\interior D is compact and disjoint from C. This exactly matches `Immersion/Relative.lean:2045–2060`; the old unjustified closure is gone.

E2:365–376 correctly makes the core derivative exactly df+A, uses a submersion in the parameter direction, states rank-r codimension `(n-r)(k-r)`, projects countably many charts, obtains `2k≤n`, and handles k=0 separately. E2:394–397 correctly distinguishes collision incidence dimension `2k+kn-n`, yielding `2k<n`. The live plane engine bounds rank defects by n+3 and collisions by n+4 inside 2n-dimensional parameter space (`Immersion/Relative.lean:1162–1228`) and promises injectivity plus immersion. Retaining `2k+1≤n` is a legitimate compatibility choice, not a claim about the sharp derivative-only threshold.

E2:110–115,382–404 honestly distinguish model-vector-space targets from the deferred manifold-source wrapper. The actual relative-immersion headline and proposed G-E2 proposition are unchanged from the successful initial legacy-context probe. No general-k proof inhabitant is being certified.

Embedding from immersion at 406–420 now describes source-dependent separating cutoffs instead of an ambient postcomposition that would preserve collisions. The live step preserves “new collision implies old collision and equal cutoff values” (`Immersion/Relative.lean:1667–1700`), and the compact bad-pair cover is used at 1990–2012. Local injectivity removes the diagonal; no finiteness of double points is required.

### Supported extension and positive-codimension disc theorem — accepted

E2:69–75,251–274 now use global diffeomorphic slices with one compact support K inside the chart source. Bijectivity gives A_t(K)=K and A_t(U)=U; the two open sets V and Y\Φ(K) cover Y and agree on their overlap. The live construction at `Transversality/Basic.lean:2547–2591` does exactly this. The separate classical velocity-field proof is explicitly context, not a promised extracted theorem. Support is no longer inferred from the namespace or from IsotopicToIdentity.

E2:77–91 now retains ambient compactness and dimension at least 2, correctly attributing both to the current proof. E2:281–287 supplies the tubular thickening used at `Transversality/Basic.lean:2723–2737`; 289–307 supplies a full-dimensional germ argument, including a smaller uniform plateau neighborhood. The positive-normal-direction frame correction leaves the zero section unchanged, as in 2154–2187. E2:309–320 supplies the ellipsoid, normal rescaling, uniform radial support, and all-real-time reparametrization, matching 2593–2645. E2:322–325 explicitly checks **Q⁻¹ R P** on the original full unit disk, matching 2694–2706. The old ambient-transport and unshrinking gaps are resolved.

### Sphere maps and finite-avoiding arcs — accepted with finding 3's extraction correction

E2:131–143 and 424–437 correctly distinguish existing Mathlib vector-valued approximation from the legacy manifold-target smoothing theorem. The actual sphere representative at `Hopf/SingularHomology.lean:14144–14160` approximates within distance 1, normalizes a nonvanishing map, and provides the normalized-segment homotopy. Lines 14199–14217 use dimension, an omitted point, and stereographic contraction. No unused D1 theorem should gate this proof.

The new §12a recovers the key dim-two mechanism: endpoint-local derivative repair, local injectivity and rescaling (`SH:18380–18427`); short arc avoiding S\{x}; finite-fixing point motion for C=(S∪{x})\{y}; postcomposition preserving embedding/immersion; and interior avoidance (`SH:18441–18505`). It does not require endpoints outside S. Remaining issues are the exact finite-avoidance dependency route and the one-sentence x case, not existence of the arc.

### Restored structure and finite-intersection signature — accepted and freshly probed

E2:684–693 reproduces all seven fields from `Morse/Cancellation.lean:3441–3450`, including the direction `d x = family (t,x)` for slices. Compactness of K remains a separate hypothesis, as it should.

E2:855–870 now gives the **complete** finite-intersection signature: ambient compactness, both compact sources, smoothness, injectivity, dimension equation, and joint derivative surjectivity. It agrees with `Hopf/SingularHomology.lean:11292–11306`. The source derives closed embeddings and combines compactness with discreteness at 11307–11311. The crossing-chart shear and discrete-plus-compact proof in §12 are correct. E13 now has an explicit destination (534,840–841).

## Commands, probes and actual outcomes

Every Git terminal invocation used `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=1 GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0=safe.directory GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_0='*'`. No scripts were sourced; especially no Git-config-altering environment script. Toolchain `/tmp/shared-lean-copy/toolchain-v4.33.0/bin` was used explicitly.

1. Start: `git rev-parse HEAD && git status --short && sha256sum Lib/docs/E2.md Lib/docs/E2-INTERFACE_RECEIPT.md` — exit 0, current snapshot above.
2. `git diff 37fc1de8a74a3b294a54fd9e804c82c074ae9591..HEAD --name-only` — exit 0, only `Lib/docs/E2.md`. This establishes that the live Lean bodies inspected in the initial independent pass did not change during the repair commit. Read all current E2; additionally inspected the current germ, ellipsoid/shrinking and finite-avoidance proof bodies again.
3. `ls -ld /tmp ~/s6-notes` — exit 0 before creation. Wrote only my own `/tmp/E2_Fresh_7e98_RepairCheck.lean`.
4. Ran:

   `/tmp/shared-lean-copy/toolchain-v4.33.0/bin/lake env /tmp/shared-lean-copy/toolchain-v4.33.0/bin/lean /tmp/E2_Fresh_7e98_RepairCheck.lean`

   **Exit 0, no errors or warnings.** The probe imported **only Hopf.SingularHomology**, opened Mathoverflow1973 and Manifold/ContDiff scopes, and:
   - recreated the seven-field structure in an isolated namespace;
   - constructed conversions in both directions to/from the existing structure;
   - reproduced the complete restored finite-intersection signature and proved it by applying the existing theorem;
   - proved the two integer dimension equivalences with omega;
   - checked six actual APIs: finite-avoiding smooth path, finite-fixing point motion, dim-two connecting arc, supported extension, tubular provider, smooth sphere representative.

   No axiom, sorry or substantive new mathematical implementation was used. This verifies compatibility with the existing legacy artifact, not a fresh compile of all split source files or production public visibility.
5. Earlier in this same review session, the unchanged G-E2 proposition elaborated as a Prop-valued lambda; plane finrank=2 and the rank arithmetic counterexample were proved. That probe exited 0 with unused-variable warnings only. Eleven API checks succeeded. Its temporary file `/tmp/E2_Fresh_37fc_Check.lean` was removed.
6. The earlier separate direct-Lib probe `/tmp/E2_Fresh_37fc_Module.lean` exited 1 because `.lake/build/lib/lean/Lib/Geometry/Manifold/Transversality/Basic.olean` **does not exist**. That is an artifact-availability failure, not a demonstrated type error or a successfully reproduced module-header diagnostic. Direct source inspection shows Basic has plain imports and no module header (`Basic.lean:6–12`). No rebuild was attempted to bypass the blocker; no direct Lib import was mixed with legacy Hopf imports. That probe was removed.
7. Process inspection in this session (`ps -eo pid,etime,args`) found no active Lean/lake build then. No build was needed or started in either pass. No lake update/cache/clean or package writes occurred.

## Final verification and cleanup

Final command `rm -- /tmp/E2_Fresh_7e98_RepairCheck.lean && git rev-parse HEAD && git status --short && git diff --check && sha256sum Lib/docs/E2.md Lib/docs/E2-INTERFACE_RECEIPT.md && test -s Lib/docs/E2-fresh-subagent-review.md && test ! -e /tmp/E2_Fresh_7e98_RepairCheck.lean` exited **0**. HEAD and both E2 hashes are **unchanged from this pass's start**. Report existence and removal of my exact probe were verified. No olean/ilean outputs were requested.

Final status is ` M Lib/docs/G.md` plus `?? AGENTS.md`. The G change appeared externally during this E2 review; it was not inspected, edited, or reverted. `git diff --check` still passed. This report's verdict is therefore tied to a stable CURRENT E2 hash, not invalidated by unrelated concurrent G work.

## Historical note and limitations

The initial pass reviewed `37fc1de8a74a3b294a54fd9e804c82c074ae9591`, E2 hash `2bc943fb7c6d2a28c3fbde42ed081e5233cbe904f93b2a06475773bbd29c86ed`, and correctly rejected its substantive gaps. An external repair commit landed during final verification. **This updated report supersedes that old-snapshot verdict and actually reviews the repaired current text.** Initial findings were formed before prior E2 reviews were consulted; this acceptance pass independently compares the repairs against those findings and the unchanged live source, not merely against an earlier favorable review.

Exact book editions/theorem numbering, a full axiom audit, full library compile, and production aggregate interface/consumer certification were not performed. Imported oleans may reflect an older unsplit legacy build; positive name/signature probes are therefore reported only in that context. Current-source correspondence was independently inspected. The open rank-stratum/helper packet is not a reason to call the repaired mathematical existence statement false.

Only this report and my uniquely named temporary probes were written. No repository source/ledger/AGENTS, package, Git configuration, other reviewer's files, commits or pushes were touched. No subagents were used. Parent should request only the targeted current corrections above, keep Axis-5 explicitly DRAFT, and avoid reporting the old major mathematical failures as still present.
