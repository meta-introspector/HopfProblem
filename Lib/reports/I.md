# Lane I, session 2 addendum (HomologyCover landed; Wang blocked)

## Landed this session

- `Lib/Topology/MappingTorus/HomologyCover.lean` (58, d92f3cf)
- `Lib/AlgebraicTopology/SingularHomology/PathClass.lean` (58, 5e9a74e — pull-forward)
- `Lib/AlgebraicTopology/SingularHomology/CrossInsert.lean` (3, 5e9a74e — pull-forward)

## Wang (`MappingTorus/Wang.lean`, IH 7576–8688, 105 decls): BLOCKED

Closure requires, besides landed material, the cross-product / circle-path cluster:
- `PeriodTorusHigherHomology.crossProduct*` + `chainBilinear*`/`homologyDesc*`/
  `homologyLinearMap*` in Hopf/Hurewicz.lean (~106 decls, dense `attribute
  [local instance] integerTensorModule in` runs), and
- `PeriodTorusHigherHomology.positiveCircleCross`, `CirclePaths.*`,
  `twoChainSmallCycle*`, `connectingHomomorphism_twoChain`,
  `crossProductEdge_path_boundary` in Hopf/LCP/CuspFilling.lean.

First extraction attempt ended in a proof-script rewrite loop (rejection test 5).
This cluster needs its own declaration-level Stage-4 cut (proposed target
`Lib/AlgebraicTopology/SingularHomology/CrossProduct.lean`) before Wang can move.
The four `LinearMap.map_smul` proof sites that failed under the local
`integerLinearMapModule` instance are the seam to re-derive first.

## Tooling

- extract.py still mangles one-line `attribute [local instance] X in` in two
  ways (head stripped + indented). Post-extract normalizer used:
  `re.sub(r'^\s*(?:attribute \[local instance\] )?((?:\w+\.)+integer(?:Tensor|LinearMap)Module) in\s*$', r'attribute [local instance] \1 in', ...)`.
  Fix the hoister before the next unit.

# Wang obstruction (2026-09-12, NEXT-STEPS item 6)

The cross-product coherence web (114 declarations) landed in
`Lib/AlgebraicTopology/SingularHomology/CrossProduct.lean` (276c58b) — that
half of item 6 is done. Landing `Lib/Topology/MappingTorus/Wang.lean`
(`MappingTorusHomology.*`, IH 7576–8684, 105 declarations, contiguous,
zero interleaved) is still obstructed, but now only by three named clusters
outside the block:

1. `Elliptic.HigherHomology.MappingTorusQuotient.*` (Specialization, lane C) —
   `Circle`, `mappingTorusHomeomorph`, `mappingTorusHomeomorph_project`,
   `project`, plus their own dependency cone (~30 declarations).
2. `PeriodTorusHigherHomology.{CirclePaths.positiveLoop, positiveCircleCross,
   connectingHomomorphism_twoChain, crossProductEdge_path_boundary,
   twoChainSmallCycle}` (CuspFilling, lane C/J) — ~8 declarations.
3. `CuspRetraction.Patching`-adjacent short helpers surfaced by the same cone.

Moving these means pure-moving lane-C/J material (the first move attempt
dragged 28 Specialization declarations before this was stopped and reverted).
They are next after the C/J owner lands those clusters in Lib, or with the
owner's blessing to move them as part of lane I.

## Wang landing attempt 2 (2026-09-13, post-rename): reverted; CHARGED boundary reached

Second full attempt to land `Lib/Topology/MappingTorus/Wang.lean`, this time
keeping the `Mathoverflow1973` wrapper (pure move, no concurrent shim or
wrapper surgery). Tooling: family-closure mover driven by build errors, plus
HEAD-order topological re-sort of the target file (needed: per-round appending
inverts declaration order and Lean resolves bare names through the current
declaration's own namespace path, so order is load-bearing).

What was proven before the revert:

- The seed families move cleanly: 115 `PassageHomology.*`/`MappingTorusHomology.*`
  declarations from `Hopf/SingularHomology.lean` and `Hopf/LCP/IntegralHomology.lean`.
- The closure then pulls, in order: `PartialChart`, `Elliptic.HigherHomology.
  MappingTorusQuotient`, `Elliptic.CyclicAction`, `Elliptic.FiniteQuotient`
  (wrapping `Elliptic.HigherHomology` wholesale, 402 + 280 declarations),
  then the period-structure universe from `Hopf/LCP/LocalModels.lean` and
  `Hopf/FiniteCore.lean`: `PeriodPoint`, `PeriodDomain`, `Lattice`,
  `LatticeMatrix`, `T₁`/`T₂`/`A₁`/`A₂`, `standardLattice`, `ComplexPlane₂`,
  `columnLattice`, and finally `SpecialPeriods.*`.

That last step is the wall. `SpecialPeriods.Threefold.*` is project vocabulary
(CHARGED per `lean-protocol.md`); a Wang `Lib/` file cannot contain it, and the
Wang sequence code as written references it. The obstruction is therefore not
mechanical but classificatory: landing Wang as a pure move requires first
splitting the period-structure cluster into a FREE core (abstract lattice with
automorphisms, the `T₁`/`T₂`/`A₁`/`A₂` gluing data, `PeriodPoint` Mobius
steps) and a CHARGED shell (`SpecialPeriods.Threefold` instantiations). That
split is a generalize-then-move item needing the textbook file, not a pure
move, and belongs to the owner's sequencing.

Also recorded for whoever retries: alias spellings (`FirstHurewicz.X` for
`SingularChains.X`, `PeriodTorusHigherHomology.X` for `SingularHomology.X`)
are shim artifacts and must be rewritten to true names at the move boundary;
standalone `@[...]` attribute lines must travel with their declaration (the
mover's doc-comment/`attribute ... in` upward walk misses them; 398 lines had
to be re-anchored in the attempt).

## Current-tree audit (2026-09-13, GLM seat run by Devin/Astra)

The historical remaining-unit list is not the current state. `HomologyCover`,
`SplitExtension`, `CentralTwist`, `TwoOpenTransition`, `Covering/Quotient`,
`Covering/DiagonalQuotient`, `Homotopy/SublevelRetraction`,
`Homotopy/LocalCollapse`, and `Covering/InvariantSubset` already exist in Lib.
The corresponding generic namespace blocks are no longer in Hopf; they are
not re-extracted. The six `CoveringOrthant` local-chart declarations are the
independent quotient-covering remainder moved by this unit. They compose a
local inverse of a quotient covering with a source chart and verify the
source, inverse, target and coordinate formulas (Forster, *Lectures on Riemann
Surfaces*, §§1–3, quotient charts).

`TwistGroup.c_twistOrder` and the two `TwistGroup.main_*` consequences remain
in Hopf: their `twistOrder` uses `S6.TwoExceptionalGluing.gluingDefect 3 4`.
This is not a pure generic extraction. The local-orbit/atlas obstructions
recorded earlier are also not claimed resolved by this unit.

### Wang ownership handoff — do not broaden the family cut

At source revision `e5a00e9`, the exact Hopf type-and-value dependency graph
for the remaining `MappingTorusHomology` and `PassageHomology` families maps
to 232 explicit source declarations: CuspFilling 71, IntegralHomology 103,
Specialization 43, SingularHomology 15. Generated kernel helper names are
not treated as reasons to move their containing source families. This
Hopf-only closure does not reach `SpecialPeriods`; the earlier wholesale
family expansion does not establish a CHARGED obstruction for this cut.

The owner explicitly kept the C/J-owned circle cross-product prerequisites
with C/J. They are not moved by this seat. **Wang and Mathoverflow1973 wrapper
removal remain pending on that ownership handoff**, not silently abandoned.
The exact candidate source names/ranges/hashes are in
`Lib/reports/I-wang-dependencies.json`; this is dependency evidence, not an
authorization to move every row. No historical draft is copied.

`MappingTorusHomology.wang_exact_at_fibre` and
`MappingTorusHomology.wang_exact_at_mappingTorus` already live in
`Lib/Topology/MappingTorus/HomologyCover.lean`. The outstanding Wang block
contains finite-cover transfer and norm formulas, not the first proof of
Wang exactness. `Lib/Topology/MappingTorus/Wang.lean` is not landed yet.

### Quotient-chart remainder receipt

Six declarations moved verbatim from `Hopf/LCP/CuspFilling.lean:1358–1400`
at `e5a00e9` into `Lib/Topology/Covering/Quotient.lean`; individual ranges,
attribute wrappers and SHA-256 hashes are recorded in
`Lib/reports/I-quotient-chart-provenance.json`. No proof term or statement
changed. The sole consumer edit is the explicit Quotient module import;
the target was already registered in `Lib.lean`.

`lake build Lib.Topology.Covering.Quotient Hopf.LCP.CuspFilling` passed with
pinned Lean 4.33.0. Temporary `I_QuotientCheck.lean`, importing only the Lib
module, checked `CoveringOrthant.localChart_symm_apply` and printed exactly
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` for
`CoveringOrthant.localChart_coordinate_identity`. Source/target byte checks
passed for all six declarations, and `git diff --check` was clean.
Census: **2,293 → 2,287**, prefix list unchanged. The next consolidated
consumer-chain gate will include this move; it is not claimed rerun here.
Wang and wrapper removal remain pending with the C/J owner as stated above.

Consolidated consumer gate after the Suspension rename: `lake build Lib
Solution S6Shortcuts S6 Challenge` and `lake env lean Lib/AxiomAudit.lean`
both exited 0 with pinned Lean 4.33.0. This includes the quotient-chart move
above; the earlier deferred-chain note is now discharged. Wang and wrapper
removal remain pending on the owner's C/J handoff.

## Wang landing (2026-09-13, GLM seat, head 27f8e7f5 + B-status commit)

`Lib/Topology/MappingTorus/Wang.lean` landed on `lib/A-8-wang` (branched from
`27f8e7f5` plus the `B.md` status commit `767b56a`): 50 declarations in two
commits — baseline `9c2dec3` (Lib file + `Lib.lean` import, Hopf untouched),
deletion `df3da70` (Hopf stock files lose the rows; the four consumers
`Hopf/LCP/{CuspFilling,IntegralHomology,Specialization}.lean` and
`Hopf/SingularHomology.lean` gain `import Lib.Topology.MappingTorus.Wang`;
full names unchanged, no shim needed).

Row accounting against the 232 recorded rows:

- 189 rows are demoted proof-side rows under `Hopf/Proof/` (owner rule: done
  last, generalisation first) and are NOT moved.
- 43 stock-side rows are moved with statements verified identical modulo
  whitespace and `@[simp]` attribute-line offsets against the recorded
  revision `e5a00e92` (block bytes drift because of the 70-file documentation
  wave, INTEGRATION-3 §3.6).
- 7 closure rows the JSON undercounts are moved with the rest: the `@[simp]`
  lemma `PeriodTorusHigherHomology.CirclePaths.circleTranslation_apply`
  (map_zero/map_one in `circleTranslationHomotopy` need it) and six private
  auto-named helpers (`biprodElement_mo1973_12801`,
  `biprod_lift_f_apply_mo1973_12802`, `biprodElement_desc_mo1973_12803`,
  `biprodElement_boundary_mo1973_12804`, `biprod_lift_eq_boundary_mo1973_12805`,
  `MappingTorusHomology.Covering.sum_range_shift_of_endpoints_mo1973_27356`),
  all six still `private` on this branch (an earlier version of this sentence
  said "de-privatized"; corrected, see the integration note below). They need
  real names in the next rename commit (hazard §7).

Spellings normalised at the move boundary: `FirstHurewicz.` -> `SingularChains.`,
`PeriodTorusHigherHomology.CircleTopology.` -> `SingularHomology.CircleTopology.`
(approved maps), plus bare cross-family references qualified to their Lib homes
(`crossProductHomology`, `crossProductEdge*`, `crossInsertLeft/Right`,
`homotopy_homologyMap`, `singularHomologyMap_{comp,id}`, the PassageHomology
cylinder family). Attribute lines are re-anchored per declaration (a blank line
between `@[simp]` and its declaration had dropped them).

Verification: `lake build Lib` green, 0 `sorry`; full chain `lake build
Solution S6Shortcuts S6 Challenge` green (8,854 jobs, 0 errors); census
1648 -> 1598, ratchet PASS (drop = the 50 moved rows); `#print axioms` on
`twoChainSmallCycle`, `connectingHomomorphism_twoChain`, `positiveCircleCross`,
`Covering.translatedPositiveLoop`, `radialCylinderDiffeomorph`,
`PartialChart.openInclusion` — all exactly `{propext, Classical.choice,
Quot.sound}`.

Tooling note for the next mover: the extraction machinery is at
`Lib/docs/logs/glm/wang_extract.py` (attr-aware up-walk: blanks are transparent
when collecting attributes) and `Lib/docs/logs/glm/wang_gen.py`
(dependency-ordered assembly: full-dotted AND bare-last-component reference
harvest, simp-order pins, trailing-attribute strip). Both were off-tree on the
seat's machine and were copied in unchanged on 2026-09-14 (record fix 1 of
`NEXT_STEPS.md`); the intermediate files they exchange (`wang_blocks.json`,
`wang_header.txt`) were not preserved, and `wang_gen.py` runs `lake build` in a
hard-coded checkout directory, so neither runs as is. The deletion used a line
mask; overlapping ranges with sequential deletion swallow neighbour declarations
(two over-deletions caught by the per-declaration-name audit and redone).

## Integration-4 note (coordinator, 2026-09-14)

Of the 50 rows landed in `Wang.lean`, 23 (the `CirclePaths.circleTranslation*`/`positiveLoop`
rows, `positiveCircleCross`, `crossProductEdge_*`, `twoChain*`, `connectingHomomorphism_twoChain`
and the five `biprod*_mo1973_*` helpers) were also moved by the Muse seat's S-path landing into
`Lib/AlgebraicTopology/SingularHomology/CirclePaths.lean`, whose other 65 declarations depend on
them. The integration kept them in `CirclePaths.lean` and removed them from `Wang.lean`, which now
imports `CirclePaths`; `Wang.lean` keeps its 27 mapping-torus rows (integration commit `80cb7a5e`).
Two corrections to the text above: the six auto-named helpers were not de-privatized on this
branch (all six were still `private` at `dd120451`; the five in `CirclePaths.lean` are public by
the Muse seat's move, `Covering.sum_range_shift_of_endpoints_mo1973_27356` stays private in
`Wang.lean`), and `biprodElement_desc_mo1973_12803` had become `private def` in `Wang.lean` (a
`theorem` at base) — moot after the deduplication, `CirclePaths.lean` keeps `theorem`. The
`/tmp/wang_extract.py`, `/tmp/wang_gen.py` tooling note cites files outside the tree; they are not
evidence for anything above and should be brought under `Lib/docs/logs/glm/` or the sentence dropped.
A further 73 `MappingTorusHomology` rows of the 189 you left under `Hopf/Proof/` are pure moves after
all: `Lib/reports/proof-split/FREED.md`.
