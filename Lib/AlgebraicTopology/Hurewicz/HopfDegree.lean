# The Hopf degree theorem

For a simply connected space whose integral homology vanishes in degrees `2 ≤ k < n`,
`Hurewicz.pi_subsingleton_of_homology_vanishing` proves that its homotopy groups
vanish in the same range. In particular, `Hurewicz.sphere_pi_subsingleton_of_lt`
proves `Subsingleton (π_ k (SphereCube.Sphere n) x)` for `2 ≤ k < n`.

On the classification side, equality of the pushed-forward cube homology class of two
based sphere maps already forces them to be homotopic relative to the basepoint:
`Hurewicz.sphere_homotopicRel_of_topClass_eq` detects equality through the
injective Hurewicz map and descends the resulting cube homotopy through the sphere
quotient. `Hurewicz.sphere_homotopic_id_of_topClass` specializes this to
self-maps of a sphere preserving the top class, and
`Hurewicz.right_inverse_is_left_inverse` turns a homotopy right inverse of a sphere map
that is injective on top homology into a two-sided inverse.

## Outline of the proof

1. Strong induction supplies all lower homotopy-group hypotheses to
   `Hurewicz.hurewiczLinearEquivOfTwoLE`.
2. Injectivity transfers the assumed homology vanishing back to homotopy.
3. `EuclideanSphere.simplyConnectedSpace` and
   `SphereHomology.unitSphere_homology_subsingleton` specialize the result to spheres.
4. Free maps are adjusted at the basepoint by the homotopy extension property of the
   simplex, transported to the cube via `Hurewicz.simplexCubeHomeomorph`, and the
   quotient cylinder lift descends the homotopy to the sphere
   (`Hurewicz.exists_basepoint_adjustment`).
5. Injectivity of the sphere map on top homology, followed by the sphere-map
   classification, turns its right inverse into a left inverse
   (`Hurewicz.right_inverse_is_left_inverse`).

## Main definitions and results

* `Hurewicz.pi_subsingleton_of_homology_vanishing`: homology vanishing implies
  homotopy vanishing below the first possible nonzero degree.
* `Hurewicz.sphere_pi_subsingleton_of_lt`: the higher connectivity of spheres.
* `Hurewicz.sphere_homotopicRel_of_topClass_eq`: based sphere maps with equal
  pushed-forward cube classes are homotopic relative to the basepoint.
* `Hurewicz.sphere_homotopic_id_of_topClass`: a self-map of a sphere fixing the
  top cube class is homotopic to the identity.
* `Hurewicz.right_inverse_is_left_inverse`: a right inverse of a sphere map
  that is injective on top homology is two-sided.

Spaces are in `Type` because the integral singular-chain interface is universe zero.
