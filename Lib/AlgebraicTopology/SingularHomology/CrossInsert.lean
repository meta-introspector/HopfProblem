# Cross-insertion chains and their naturality

  Cross-insertion: the chain map inserting a point of `X` as a degenerate
  `Y`-factor in the singular chains of `X x Y`, its naturality in both factors,
  and the induced map on homology (Eilenberg-Steenrod, Foundations of Algebraic
  Topology, VIII.6, chain-level precursor of cross products).
